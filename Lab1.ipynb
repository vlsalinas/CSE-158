Slow but steady stream of small bubble carbonation looks inviting. The head quickly spreads out to thinly coat the surface with a good ring and lacing. Smells very hoppy, banana, cantaloupe, vanilla, spice. Taste is dry with a flash of tartness, bitter, hoppy impressions are pronounced but not over the top, a nice drinking IPA. Mouthfeel was smooth with a lingering ginger-hoppy aftertaste. A swirl produces a regenerated head until the end of the glass. The 7.2% alcohol is well hidden in the mix. I found this to be comparable to the better IPA's I've tasted and I'll try to grab a six pack next time along with the other Founders products, the Bells, the Jolly Pumpkin and Dragonmead offerings - to name but a small sampling of what Merchant's in Dearborn offers.\",\n",

Label suggests it's a bigger version of BORIS. \\t\\tAPPEARANCE: Pours black and relatively thick and vicious looking. Pour yields a cascading 1 finger, thicker looking dark mocha head that eventually fades to a splotchy wisp and ring. Jet black body and zero carbonation evident. A ring and splotchy wisp remains until the end leaving some dots of lacing that slowly slide down the glass after each sip. Basically the same as BORIS, but the head is a little thicker and more persistent. \\t\\tSMELL: Roasted malts, smoke, dark baker's chocolate, and the oats are very apparent. Slight hints of caramel, tobacco, and coffee notes. A complex nose, but needs to be just a little bolder to really give it that edge. Same as BORIS. \\t\\tTASTE: Same as BORIS, but a bit more booze on the swallow and a bolder and longer lasting aftertaste. Roasted and smoky malts, dark baker's chocolate and a good dose of oats again. Dark pure chocolate with a nice balance of bitter coffee, sweet caramel and booze on the finish. Oats are in there as well. The aftertaste is bold and very persistent. A little bigger and than BORIS, especially after the swallow. Really good stuff.\\t\\tPALATE: Medium-full body, slightly lower end carbonation, and very creamy smooth on the palate, even slightly oily. Goes down smooth, very soft and easy, not bite at all, and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Very similar to BORIS, but even slightly more creamier and oily on the palate. Very nice indeed. \\t\\tOVERALL: Shit is good. A slightly bigger and bolder version of BORIS is what they were after, and a slightly bigger and bolder version is what they've achieved. They say this right on the bottle, and they didn't lie. Lots of great bold flavors, and a bigger palate to support them. This is one worth seeking out for sure. Unfortunately it's relatively tough to come by. Thanks for hooking me up with bottles of this Tom and Joe.\",\n",

The whiskey barrel adds strong oak and vanilla notes to the mix; which really compliments the malt forward profile. To add good measure... the belgian yeast adds a lively spice that keeps things interesting. \\t\\tMouthfeel: This beer is full bodied and has low carbonation. Smooth and delicious. This beer is 11% and the only way of knowing is looking at the label. No boozey burn and no harshness is encountered. Its hard to believe that this beer has NOT been in a cellar for a few years; when its actually quite fresh. Damn!\\t\\tOverall: This is the BEST Hoppin Frog beer I have drank!

The creamy foam settles slowly and leaves nice lace.\\t\\tS - A perfumey aroma of hops and malt with notes of caramel, toasted malt, and floral, jasmine and hibiscus, hops. Some clove and black pepper spice, with honey-like pilsner malt character.\\t\\tT - Moderately sweet, toasty malt up front with some herbal hop and yeast flavors. Floral hop flavors with a hint of grapefruit and pine. Finishes with thick malt and strong, sharp bitterness that scours the palate and leaves only a slight lingering honey malt character in its wake.\\t\\tM - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a fairly dry finish with very astringent bitterness.\\t\\tD - This is not at all what I expected it to be. Based on my previous experience with their offerings, I really expected an assault of pine and citrus, instead, I got a nose full of floral, spicy hops. This makes for a nice aroma that melds well with the rich malt. Unfortunately this pleasant balance does not carry over into the flavor. The hop flavor is more subdued and muddy, and instead of augmenting the malt, the two just kind of merge into a grey blandness. I could live with this slightly disappointing flavor, but the harsh, astringent bitterness really kills it for me; it is chalky, sour, and (as another reviewer noted) distinctly aspirin-like. This beer isn't a drain pour, but, aside from the pleasant aroma, it is a disappointment that I won't be dropping $10 on again. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.\",\n",

Heavy notes of bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee and a touch of brandy dominate this beer. Its quite rich and full, making consuming an entire 750 by one's self a somewhat daunting task (though not something I'd complain about). I'm glad I had the discipline to put this one away for a year. I may purchase another and age for even longer.\",\n",

This Hellesbier pours up with a subtle carbonation that creates a lacy, white head that prominently sits atop a superb bright, straw-golden body. The alluring aroma displays some honeyish maltiness that's reminiscent of freshly baked European sweetbread. In addition, there's a noticeable spiciness from the noble Hallertauer hops, as well as the impression of smokiness (phenols) as the beer warms in the glass... although this may be completely psychosomatic? The smooth, easy going flavor starts off with a simply lovely, grainy-sweet maltiness that is marked a perfect amount of spicy bitterness to balance. This finely engineered medium bodied lager finishes gently crisp & extremely smooth with a definite hint of smokiness. Highly recommended and extremely drinkable! Suggested food pairings include Franconian beernuckles with fried potatoes or some Butterkse cheese with herb crusted crackers.

Clarity was more akin to a heavy ale than a typical porter. Head left a little to be desired, but I have a feeling this was more due to bottle pouring. Good color to it, but sadly it maxed out at a quarter inch thick or so.\\t\\tS- First whiff and the roasted/malty smell came roaring out. Not overbearing, but apparent. There was just a hint of a dark chocolate smell.\\t\\tT- The taste was solid, but definitely not the best porter I've ever had. The roasted malt flavor was definitely there, but by no means overbearing. I only noticed the chocolate if I let the beer sit in my mouth for a bit or really paid attention to the aftertaste. I think strengthening the chocolate would have improved my opinion a bit.\\t\\tM- This is where the beer loses some points with me, sadly. I can't really put my finger on it, exactly, but the beer almost felt watered down. While this added to the relatively light texture of the beer, I think a heavier feel would have been more appropriate for this style of brew.\\t\\tD- Overall, I enjoyed the Polygamy Porter. It went down easily and had good flavor. If I saw it on tap, I'd likely have a glass. Wasatch has done a decent job, and I look forward to trying their other brews.\",\n",

The taste is not as skunked as the aroma. There is a maltiness to this beer. It finishes with a slight bitterness, and seems a bit thin in the body. The Saaz flavor is fairly muted at this point.\\t\\tWhen fresh: This beer is quite nice, a nice solid maltyness that helps to express the Saaz hops. I love a good fresh pils when done correctly. Seems to have lost a bit of fullness and complexity over the years but it is still quite good when fresh.\\t\\tOverall this rates fairly average b/c of the preponderance of storing this in green bottles.\"',\n",

This is essentially a \"Rauch-dunkelweizen\" and the flavor profiles of these styles don\\'t harmonize very well. The Weizen flavors of clove and spice create a very astringent, medicinal beer when combined with the intense smokiness. The toasty, lightly chocolatey malts make this a complex beer, but I don\\'t think it works in the end. This is also probably the driest wheat beer I\\'ve had.

It is a full bodied beer with slight carbonation, higher ABV make the beer somewhat tough. Overall it wasn't too bad of a beer....better than other Belgiums I have had.\",\n",

Very enticing aroma, with raisins and spices, sweet bread, caramel, brown sugar, fruitcake, a hint of diacetyl and suggestions of molasses, chocolate and pecans. Lots of spicy hop flavor and bitterness, balanced by fruity alcohol and a chewy, complex maltiness that imparts ripe raisin and sweet, dark bread. The body is thick and coating, powdery at times, and leaves a medium finish. This is a hugely malty beer with enough hops to balance, and makes for a delicious evening sipper.',\n",

As they slowly recede patterned lacing is left intermittently around the glass. Translucency is low, as a deep haze permeates the liquid. No sediment is noted otherwise. Carbonation appears to be average. The aroma is bright with soapy hops. There are notes of grassy bitterness and an earthy metallic bite to them as well. The malts, as advertised, are deep, roasty, and caramelized. They have the slightest charcoal character, but really are more brown sugary and lofty with diacetyls. There is also a band-aid/medicinal quality, but this can be attributed back to the hops. The yeast is bready and has a bit of spice, making the nostrils sing a bit on the way back. As we sip, a sweeter caramel malt hits up front. These predominate until the middle of the flavoring where they morph into a bitter darker roasted malt. Here is where the hops really start to pick up, and at their peak they exhibit a further degree of bitterness and a good deal of soapiness. This quickly mellows out to a smoother finish, with a nice balance of those deep and bitter malts, with those spicy, soapy hops. The aftertaste breathes with a peachy fruitiness, a strong black tea tannin-like flavor, bittering and soapy hops, and some sickly sweet booze. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is lighter. The feel with each swig is with significant slurp and slosh. This stems from creaminess imparted by the well retained head. The mouth is ultimately left on the drier side due to the tannin quality and the bitter action from the hops. The abv is appropriate and the beer drinks easily.\\t\\tOverall, what we enjoyed best about this brew was the spicy and hoppy nose. The hops were certainly bright enough to justify this being classified as it is, but there was also a surprisingly pleasant warming from some sweet malts used. This made room for a nice balance, and was subsequently noted in the flavoring. While this was appreciated, and very much what it seemed like the brewers were going for, it made for a robust flavoring that, at times, took over for the hoppiness that this IPA should have exhibited more strongly.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I love all things Kirkland and am also a big fan of Costco, but this beer was a genuine let-down. As a craft beer fan, I love hops that really punch you in the face, but as a realistic beer consumer, I also know that a lot of people who drink beer DON\\'T like this, and as a result there are quite a few more mild mannered beers out there, which is fine. I guess what is disappointing to me about this beer is that the name \"pale ale\" sort of implies to me that at least some discernible hop presence is contained within the bottle, and I did not find that to be the case here. Much like Bud American Ale, which promised hops and taste and delivered a disappointing blandness, I feel as though this beer is not what it implies.\\t\\tIt pours an attractive brassy color, with a pretty nice amount of head. Aroma is biscuity and malty, and not really at all hoppy. Flavor is very mildly hoppy - these beers are relatively new and the one I tried I thought was fresh, but the flavor within reminded me of hops gone bad - like when a super hoppy beer gets old and loses both its hop punch and its balance, becoming a big malt-ball. Mouthfeel was unremarkable.\\t\\tI love Costco, and I am a big fan of their store brand (Kirkland), but that respect does not extend to their beer. I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Bottle purchased at Table & Vine, West Springfield, MA.\\t\\tPours a clear, medium body orange with a nice sheen. A fairly generous layer of light foamy slightly off-white head.\\t\\tThe dominant smell is fruity hops, especially citrus. I detect grapefruit, maybe even a little tangerine. Perhaps even some tropical fruit like a banana or mango in there somewhere. On second sniff, a touch of bready malt, but the hops still rule. No alcohol detectable on the nose.\\t\\tTaste begins with an aggressive but not overwhelming bitterness. A little malt sweetness cuts through, but not much. Something very drying (a touch of tannin maybe) towards the back of the throat, but this still does not leave one's palate exhausted, unlike some American IPAs. \\t\\tThe carbonation is enough to lift the beer into the far reaches of the mouth, but not enough to feel like one is inhaling gas or anything. Allowing the beer to warm a bit, a touch of alcohol comes through, but not as much as its 7.2% suggests.\\t\\tThis beer is often touted by many BAs as the epitome of the American IPA. While I'm not certain I can call it my absolute favorite, it's damned close.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I've got well over 30 beers languishing in my notes to review, but for some reason - it could be the torrential rain on a dreary November day - I felt like something woody, something soothing, something... bourbony! Thanks to my fridge for hanging onto this one for a while. 2009 vintage.\\t\\tA. Backwoods Bastard is a dirty looking, sediment-heavy, caramel red with just a touch of lacy head that eventually flattens out. Looks a bit thin and watery, the yeasty bits remain suspended in the brew. One of the odder looking brews to grace this snifter.\\t\\tS. Initial nose is sweet malt and a pronounced woodiness, followed by brown sugar, a bit of char and a good amount of bourbon and alcohol heat. There's an estery, date-like sweetness that's often found in barrel aged beers, but it too seems overmuch. As it warms you get more: vanilla, a bit of heather-dirt, more nuanced roasty-sweet malt. Not bad. But as a whole the experience is sweet, sharp, and boozy.\\t\\tT. Hmm... what we have here is an over-bourboned, very sweet Wee Heavy. Now, I love bourbon, but it needs to be in harmony to the beer (see BA Sexual Chocolate for a world-class example) or be so insanely tasty that you just don't care. Backwoods Bastard is not quite there. There's a big estery, brown-sugar sweetness, a LOT of barrel character, and booze to spare. This is 10% and shows. The bourbon is the heart and soul of this beer, the scotch ale (the more interesting flavor to be had) seems to work around it, filling in the cracks in the woody, sweet, alcoholic and warming base. The sweetness is just shy of being too much, and the finish is sugary, woody and warm with some distracting aspirin-like bitterness.\\t\\tM / D. Strangely thin, not quite watery. Carbonation is low but adds some needed punch; I would prefer more. Not easy to drink, I'm sorry to say. The bourbon is too sharp, the sweetness distracting. Founder's own Old Curmudgeon does this thing better.\\t\\tBackwoods Bastard isn't exactly a miss, but if I was doing this in a lineup I'd use it of an example of a bourbon beer that doesn't quite hit the mark.\",\n",

The aroma is rich, heavily roasted and somewhat burnt malts - gives a slight coffee aroma. Sweet aroma with some fruit flavors. Alcohol is there but is a gives a nice rich mix with everything else. The flavor is extremely good, burnt flavor gives it some astringency, little charcoaly in feel and flavor. Coffee comes out more here along with chocolate flavors. The tail end has a nice bitterness, wondering how much comes from hops and how much could come from the burnt malts? The alcohol really adds a nice complexity as it complements everything. The feel of this brew is almost like a milkshake, has a nice and thick creamy feel. I could clearly have another one of these as the flavors are great but I think the alcohol would get to me. This is nice sipper, a good cold weather brew!',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'A bottle-conditioned beer purchased at the RAIB (Real Ale In Bottle) stall, GBBF 06. Coming in a 500ml brown bottle, it is made from \"Maris Otter barley grown at Branthill Farm, Wells next the Sea\", using Chocolate malts... BB July 2007, Batch No. CN0616, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass.\\t\\tA: deep and dark brownish in colour, with mahogany glows against light; poured carefully to avoid sediments so the tan beer head is quite thin and dissipates fast; very low carbonation as far as my eyes manage to see throught the nearly-black nectar.\\tS: deep yet mild roast-nutty dark malts, with chunks of raw-ish bitter chocolates and calcium-pills at the back--bitter-sweet nutty as well as chocolatey at the same time... no assertive input of hops detected, while a tinge of vinous dark-fruits lags behind. Pretty simple in composition, but nice.\\tT: profoundly bitter roasted malts quietly flood the whole palate, yet so smoothly-textured... quickly bringing along an aromatic edge of Chinese walnut-date cake, chewy and rough charred wood-chips, and an intensifyingly bitter taste like 70%-90% dark chocolates with a mildly sour-bitter kick; an incredible length of dryish bitterness lingers down the rear and wings of the tongue, like ground dried root-herbs and licorice\\'s dryish-sweetness, but even more soothingly bitter...\\tM&D: softly-carbonated and smoother than smooth, even a bit oily as far as the lubricating maltiness is concerned... allowing the bitter-ish roastiness to roam freely on the palate without any hurdles. Medium-plus bodied, full-flavoured stout, brilliant bottle-conditioning; although the flavour itself is not as complex as some other English stouts I\\'ve had, this beer\\'s depth is definitely one of the most impressive and the 5.5% alc. simply dissolves in the nectar, making it an utterly-quaffable session stout. I feel so lucky to have picked up this RAIB from the GBBF this year, and firmly believe that any stout/porter-lover would fall for it.',\n",

I have no idea what a \"porter\" is vs a \"stout\" but this tastes like a great porter. Hops are noticed but not over powering.

Very little head but then again most beers of this style don't have much head so in comparison to the style it is good. \\t\\tS- This has your typical lager yeast smell. There is a bready, earthy, grainy and gritty smell. Very rounded and bold smells in terms of beer of this style.\\t\\tT- The beer is crisp and refreshing. I'm getting a big grain taste that is like chewing on the top of a barley stalk. More like the smell of when a grain truck dumps its freshly harvested barley load into the grain grate to be weighed and priced, take that smell and put it as a taste and that's what I'm getting. There is a subtle sweet honey taste that is coming though and adds a nice level of flavor. There is actually a nice complexity going on with this beer, especially when you are comparing it to other beers of the style. \\t\\tM- Good mouthfeel, nice carbination and a very light body.\\t\\tD- Easy to drink, the name of the beer fits very well. I would drink this after working out in the yard no prob. This is clean but not BMC clean. It's more like clean but in a dirty glass type clean. \\t\\tLagers are not my favorite styles of beer. But one thing I've found is that the flavors are more subtle then other styles. Many craft lagers get a bad wrap because of BMC lagers and how many people are so against them here on BA. I rated this beer based on its style, and for its style it is very well done and tasty. I would definitely buy this one again.\",\n",

The label claims that the beer rates 168 IBU (is there any way to independently verify this?), and this bomber has plenty of fragrant hops in its aroma. The resiny goodness of grapefruit zest and pine needles are present in abundance along with a definite hint of lychee fruit. The malts are there somewhere in a buttery background, but the hops are dominant. In the mouth, the malts make their presence known despite the intensity of the hops. The hops are fresh, biting, and delicious and are clearly the star of the show, but the malts keep it from being a solo performance. The aftertaste lingers in the form of a mouth-coating citrus zestiness well after the sip has made its way down the throat. The taste sticks around long enough to make you nod in approval at drinking such a fine brew, and as it fades, it reminds you that you can do it all again with the next sip. Highly drinkable and highly recommended.',\n",

First bottle was incredibly foamy, possibly infected, so I was maybe too careful with the second since this time there's no head to speak of. Dark for the style. Good caramel malts with rich butter and toffee flavors overshadowed by indelibly tart green apple flavor. Initially an interesting balance but grows tiresome. Mouthfeel a touch too fizzy, like soda. I don't know if the apple flavor comes from the hops but it serves the same purpose, to dry out the finish but unfortunately does not tickle the tongue into wanting more sips. I wonder if these could be old bottles since they seem a bit off; not ruined but lacking refinement. Put dates on your labels, Cooperstown.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"This beer is from the tiny (6 employees!) O'Fallon Brewery just west of St. Louis, Missouri. Usually when one thinks of chocolate and cherry flavors in beer, one tends to think of a dark. thick stout. This beer takes a different approach: O'Fallon has used something akin to a pale ale as the base of their Cherry Chocolate Ale. It pours a dark amber color which is hazy from yeast and/or chocolate. A smallish tan head fades pretty quickly and leaves no lace. Aroma is of malt and chocolate with a bit of yeast and maybe a slight hint of cherry. I really liked the smell of this beer! Taste starts like a typical pale ale but you quickly notice the chocolate which is the predominant flavor. A natural light cherry flavor is apparent, too. The cherry is not artificial or medicinal tasting at all! The flavors are also not sweet or cloying in the least. Hops are present, but quite subdued to let the chocolate and cherry flavors come through. Mouthfeel is pretty light as is typical of pale ales. Pretty drinkable, but I don't think you'd want 3 or 4 of these in a row. I'd say this is very unusual for a chocolate/fruit flavored beer, and definitely worth a try. I'd buy it again as a novelty or as a light dessert beer.\",\n",

I poured it rather aggressively and all I could get was a handful of small white bubbles. Smell is huge. There is a huge hop bouquet with sweet malts following quickly. Also notes of raisins and chocolate. The taste of the beer is hops. It's just huge. Probably one of the hopiest beers I have ever had. It is also one of the most acidic beers I have ever drank also. It's hard to drink because of its acidity. Mouthfeel is good. More like a barleywine then a DIPA. It's really had to drink.

       "  'review/text': 'Pike makes some of the best British style beers in the US; this is a remarkably authentic pale ale that tastes like it could come directly from a traditional English brewery. This is mostly due to the complex malt profile (Maris Otter?) with flavors of bread crust, biscuit, graham cracker. Hops go against the Pacific Northwest stereotype and instead are muted, subtle, faintly herbal like many of the best British ales. Mouthfeel is soft, cushiony and I can understand why others found it watery but I had no problem with it. Lots of other complex things going on; at times it tastes spicy like a Christmas beer, other times it is simple unadulterated toffeeish malt. The sign of a good beer (or wine, or whisky) is that each sip is a different experience. This is quite simply an amazing beer, and as satisfying and drinkable a bevarage you could hope for.',\n",

Just reviewed a KBS last night so figured I should break out one of this for a comparison.\\t\\tA: Pours a syrupy very dark chocolate brown color and settles into the glass a still near pitch black liquid. Hard pour leaves a bubbly two finger thick head, dark tan, mochaish. Not quite as retentive as KBS, dissipates to a very thin head with a large clump of medium sized bubbles. Nice, thick web like lacing. \\tS: Not quite as overpowering or rich as KBS but pretty amazing regardless. My first thought is baskin robbins jamoca almond fudge ice cream and this definitely has a much stronger chocolate presence along with the coffee ground aromas. There is also a slightly stronger bitterness to this than the KBS and mild dark fruit smell. Not much of an alcohol presence anywhere. \\tT: It's very obvious drinking these two side by side that the KBS isn't just a barrel aged version of this beer. There is a very strong, slightly bitter black coffee/ground taste that persists throughout this beer. However that is balanced with a strong sweet, milk chocolate like presence in the beginning. Near the finish is an oatmeal stout taste that balances the coffee grounds. The taste of this beer is incredibly persistent, just like KBS, that is very pleasant and leaves you wanting more of this. \\tM: Thicker side of medium bodied, but not quite as thick as KBS. Still, very creamy, smooth. slight bitterness from the coffee and finish is like drinking a cup of coffee. Finish is not as clean or crisp as KBS, but still very pleasant. I always enjoy drinking this beer slightly cooler than room temperature and letting it warm up as the coffee and chocolate flavors will alternate dominating the taste. \\tD: Only place that I rate this above KBS, as much as I enjoy the bourbon/oak flavors in the KBS that makes it more a special occasion beer and for me there's really nothing here holding me back from wanting more of this all the time. Great to sip on and I'm always left wanting more. My favorite of the coffee/breakfast stouts I've tried, far ahead of Terrapin wake'n'bake, Bell's java, Southern Tier Jah-va, etc.\",\n",

It is the kind of smoky that you smell on your clothes the morning after sitting around a campfire all night. The taste is much the same but the sweetness of the malt comes through a little in the end. It is not too thick which you assume after smelling it but is rather light which is what you expect from a Weizen. This one is very refreshing but still odd and different being a rauchbier.

Here goes...\\t\\tA- A very nice pour yields a darker amber color that is not expected, but very appealing to gaze at. Darker than pumking and looks just as appetizing. A very nice stream of bubbles presents a thin white head that dissipates quickly. I love how it looks reminds me faintly of lighter pumpkin bread. Can't wait to indulge. \\t\\tS- Right away a greeting of fresh pumpkins followed by nutmeg, cinnamon and I want to say clove. Quite intriguing and lovely to smell. I am picking up more of the spices as it warms they are overpowering the pumpkin and leaving it in the back. It's making me drool as this is one of my favorite seasonal styles. \\t\\tT- Tons of the nutmeg, cinnamon and other spiciness used in pumpkin pies. Lovely taste not a lot of pumpkins very faint because it is dominated by the spices used. As it warms I get a subtle crust taste, but not as much as I would like because the spices take over. \\t\\tM- Coats the mouth and leaves you awaiting your next sip. The carbonation is there and melds well with all the spices leaving them lingering around. Enjoyable, but a little chewier than others, probably the malt bill chiming in to leave it fuller bodies than some pumpkin brews. \\t\\tD- As like most of this style its a desert beer not a session beer. It is to be enjoyed with pumpkin pies, sweet potato pies, cranberry sauce. For the high abv its fairly drinkable, but I will stick to the tried and true Pumking for now. \\t\\tA great representation for the style, up there with the greats of this style. Very pleasing and would try again next season to see if the recipe changes. Would like more pumpkin less spice or maybe even a vanilla pinch to throttle down the cinnamon and nutmeg.\",\n",

Dark malts emerge on closer inspection, smelling like a good stout.\\t\\tT: The regular BORIS does its best to stand out up front, throwing out dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee flavors. After the initial stout flavors, the bourbon and barrel gradually emerge. Oak and vanilla stand out, softening up the stout to a cocoa powder sweetness. A flourish of booziness peaks through near the end of each sip. The bourbon adds a bit of burn to each sip.\\t\\tM: The mouthfeel doesn't skimp on either the stout or the barrel. The bourbon isn't as crisp as in some stouts but you can tell that it is there.\\t\\tD: At nearly 10%, this is a sippin' stout. I've had both Batch 1 and 2 and I cast my vote for Batch 1.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Found singles for sale in central MA a couple months back, and decided to drink one tonight. Poured into a DFH oversized snifter. The color of this beer is black as tar. I have not seen a beer recently that was this dark. Thick, caramel colored head forms at the very end of the pour. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is intense. Lots of vanilla and aromatic coffee notes, with a hint of smokiness. The smell is boozy and sweet, but the flavor is dry and balanced. There is a definite bourbon flavor, but that is matched equally with a coffee liqueur counterpoint. An amazing amount of flavors that don\\'t overwhelm each other, but all are in harmony. Mouthfeel was probably one of the \"chewiest\" beers I can recall. At first, it reminded me of syrup or pudding. But it mellowed out to be more stout like. I actually preferred this beer cold right out of the bottle. It seemed to lose some of the mouthfeel and flavor as it warmed up. Call that odd, but it seemed to be the opposite most times as true for me this time. Took a while to drink this beer, due to the viscosity, the abv and overall size of this beer. One serving was enough for me, but that one bottle was quite a journey. A great brew.',\n",

As with most dark beers from founders there is also chocolate and some coffee present.\\t\\tT- This porter is very rich tasting with a focus on the chocolate and burnt malts but neither outweigh the other. Some coffee creeps in along with some molasses and carmel, while the hops keep everything in prespective. \\t\\tM- Founders porter has a great mouthfeel to it. Medium to full bodied. The carbonation is present, prehaps a bit too much. The creamy nature of this porter is a delight to drink, making it easy to finish 12oz before you know it. Good thing i have extras.\\t\\tD- I'm glad that this is only 6.5% because I can't stop drinking this porter. I could easily finish three of these, possibly four over a night without growing tired of it.

After each drink patchy mountainous lacing runs down the glass.\\t\\tThe smokiness hits as soon as I pop the top but after some carbonation is released on the pour and some settling occurs the smoke fades slightly becoming more integrated. The smokiness sends up wonderful aromas of campfire with bacon cooking in the background. Roastiness hides underneath it all with a touch of dark chocolate. Each swirl of the glass brings the aroma alive.\\t\\tTaste echoes the aroma quite well. Smokiness takes the stage front, center, and rear. The smell of the open campfire and bacon grilling away in a cast iron skillet fill my mind. The smoke is done just right. With some more pondering the roastiness comes alive with a mild dark chocolate and cream like sweetness on the swallow. \\t\\tThe body is a little lighter then what you would expect. It's on the lighter side of medium but it's all at once smooth and creamy. There is enough carbonation to tickle the tongue.\\t\\tI boosted the drinkability here because on a cool fall day, out in the yard with a slight chill this beer can be drank and enjoyed by the gallon. A cool day today brings back those thoughts.\\t\\tO'Fallons Smoke is one of my favorite smoked beers available in the Chicagoland area. This is an easy to find, relatively cheap, and an enjoyable sipper. I'm enjoying this bomber with a couple squares of Mo's Bacon Bar and I haven't come across a better combination yet.\",\n",

This is a great non-session beer. I feel that its brother (KBS) often overshadows it (respectively). This is a different beast and will take the chill out of winter. It hides its 8.3% very well through the bitter and tartness and the BA is left with a warming feel that seems to sooth over the day. Amazing.',\n",

Moderately hot alcohol upfront and again in my chest. Feel is very heavy, sticky and just carbonated enough to keep from falling flat.

It's nitpicking, but perhaps a bit too much coffee. I would have liked the slightest bit less coffee flavor.\\t\\tM - Thick, chewy and smooth - almost oil-like consistency.\\t\\tO - Phenomenal American imperial stout. At the top of its class, and sets the bar for what other imperial stouts should be aiming for. The ABV is just about perfect (not too strong, not too weak) at 8.3%. A near perfect beer, and one of my favorites.\\t\\tNote: This beer is even better on tap.\",\n",

A thin, fizzy pink head develops and fizzles out almost immediately leaving as close to zero head as possible. No lacing to speak of.\\t\\tThe nose is extremely sweet and that is apparent as soon as the beer leaves the bottle and heads to the glass. Raspberries are present in copious amounts.

At times it really isn't appealing at all and at others it seems to be an enticing array of fruity aromas.\\t\\tThe taste follows along with the nose fairly closely. The first sip brings a great rush of slight tart raspberries. Really not much else, just huge, juicy raspberry flavor. At other times the sweetness is overwhelming and overpowering. The tartness isn't too much, in fact, it's not really that tart. It's the sweetness that gets to you after a bit. There really isn't much complexity with this beer, just a huge rush of sweet raspberry flavor.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is surprisingly full with prickly carbonation that numbs the tongue a bit. A slight tartness is present, but it's not mouth puckering.\\t\\tI'm torn on this beer. At times it can be a great, sweet rush of raspberry juiciness. At others it's a sickly sweet mouth full of carbonated raspberry juice. There isn't much depth or complexity to it. No sign of the Belgian yeast and none of the ABV shows it's face at all. Probably best enjoyed in small samples rather than full pours.\",\n",

Too dark to see any carb. Great lacing. It had a massive dark brown head that took forever to settle down into a light foam and thin collar. \\t\\tThe aroma was roasted and chocolate malts primarily. Along sweet malt and alcohol present. The alcohol aroma was a tad too strong so hurt the score slightly. Not sure of the age of this one so the alcohol might settle with more aging...or not. The taste was really good but again was impacted by the alcohol. This one seemed to be still hot. I know it's a high ABV and this style comes with alcohol taste usually but I've had several that have either settled with age or hide it a little better. It's still an outstanding beer but I prefer a little less hot. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. \\t\\tOverall, a really good beer that I highly recommend. Mine was a little hot so looking forward to getting another and aging for 6 months to try again. My first Hoppin' Frog but eager to try some more from them.\",\n",

As the beer warms slight amounts of vanilla make an appearance but the roasted malt and chocolate aromas dominate.\\t\\tTastes better balanced than it smells. Smooth roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by light amounts of vanilla and oak. Midway through the sip the flavors smooth out further with the addition of light chocolate. The peppers come into play near the end of the sip, carrying through to a moderately bitter ending and leaving a bit of heat on the back of the palate.\\t\\tMouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with decent carbonation.\\t\\tDrinkability is also good. I didn't have a problem finishing my glass and could have another.\\t\\tOverall I thought the peppers were nicely done - not too overpowering. Additionally, the oak chips were nicely integrated.

Yum, lets sip again! \\t(Some aging has mellowed the bourbon and helped bring out the chocolate and hop bitterness. The overall balance is nice.)\\t\\tIf there is a weakness of this beer, I would say it is the lack of carbonation. I feel that a touch of extra bubbles would add to the excitement of the mouth feel.

Maybe the fact that it was just tapped mere moments before I got there, I was in the mood for a super fresh light lager. Served cold and in a pint glass, this one was consumed on 01/26/2010. \\t \\tThe pour was very light. Golden yellow with loads of carbonation streaming up through the glass which led to a big head of white foam that capped it gracefully. This settled quickly though and left behind a broken, almost rocky crown that barely disguised the liquid underneath. Aroma was light, very light with touches of grain and almost corn. A hit of wheat and light bready notes dominated. I searched for something more but really just did not pick it up. Wish I had. The flavor was more of the same, it was clean and crisp, with a nice level of carbonation but really just seemed to be lacking in power. Nice bready touches, muted grains but that was about it. Just did not have the punch to push it over the edge. Certainly drinkable, but flavor was not doing it for me. \\t \\tOverall while being fairly solid and well rounded it really does not stand out in the pack. Needed a little bit more follow through and a richer, deeper profile to really peak my interest.',\n",

Very sporadic minimal spots of lacing.\\t\\tSubtle bourbon aroma with hints of vanilla as well as some caramel/chocolate malt.

This is quickly balanced by a smooth silky chocolate maltiness with hints of toffee and hazelnut. The bourbon character comes through really nicely midway through and lasts throughout into a lingering sweet finish. The bourbon character is not overpowering, letting the complex flavors from the hops shine through even in the finish where the bourbon flavor is most prominent. There are still some dry pine and citrus notes in the finish. Very complex and more balanced than I expected. The alcohol is very well masked and there is not much heat/warmth making it pretty drinkable.\",\n",

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, earth, caramel hop, butterscotch, and subtle sweet milk. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, earthy, earthy hop, subtle citrus, and butterscotch. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The flavors were very well blended and complimented each other quite well. This made this brew quite easy to drink and could be a good intro brew for n00bs to craft beer. Tick.',\n",

You may even be willing to say it is the greatest thing on earth depending. I consumed a fair amount of this and other like brews while spending 2 months in West Africa. Honestly I think it is pretty hard to tell Club and Star apart, may depend on how cold the establishment was able to serve the particular beer. Nice gold color, pretty good head, nice aroma (you know it is beer). Neutral but refreshing taste, a bit of skunk.

Can't really pick one out, it's not just Centennial or just one hop. You can tell that there is a ton going on in this beer. Taste gets muddled. There's a touch of Malts here, but then there's the confusion of the hops. There's a hint of grapefruit/ citruis from Cascade/Centennial here, but there's also the earthiness from Fuggles, I'm guessing, and some floral hits as well. The problem I have is that it's not well put together. It's just a bunch of hops thrown together. Mouthfeel is thick and lush.

       "  'review/text': \"Right from the pour, I could tell this was going to be a fairly thick, slightly syrupy, full bodied beer. It pours a clear, golden, honey, orange color, with a slight white head if you dump the beer into the glass quickly. There isn't much retention or lacing. There is a bit of carbonation for a bock beer, which is a plus. The aroma is not all that pungent or pronounced. I'm getting sweet malts, florals, maybe a touch of orange blossom. For what it is worth, the labeling on the beer has changed.\\t\\tThe taste is quite sweet in the body, some grainy flavors emerge and there is a slightly vinous grape skin tinge to the beer; and then the biting spices come in on the back end. Also present are some citrus notes, and a very peppery bite on the end. The beer is quite oily on the tongue and full bodied. There aren't heaps of hops in this beer, but the spices add the bitterness. The hops are in the noble family. The 7% ABV is pretty well hidden. The thick pour and rich consistency makes this a not-every-down type bock. Watery and thin this is not.\",\n",

Has a initial tart bite, not bad, but quickly turns to foul beer experiment. This is exactly what a first-time homebrewer would concoct with a fairly cheap beer kit.

Within seconds the surface is as still and dark as Satan's infernal lake. Its a daunting black, but the lack of head brings things down. Loads of coffee, anise and bittersweet chocolate in the nose. A very heavy roast announcing a serious stout. This is an imperial that doesn't need any added bells or whistles. Its not steeped in coffee beans, barrel aged or brewed with vanilla beans... its just a damn solid regular imperial stout. Coffee is the dominant feature of the flavour, but with a backing of bittersweet chocolate and anise. Some faint dark fruit and moderate hopping add some more complexity. A nice combination of roasted malt flavours. The one thing that does disappoint is that for an oatmeal added stout the body is far lighter than it should be to maximise the flavours and heft. I was hoping for a thick, almost sludgy pour, but its actually fairly medium-bodied in the mouth, with a medium carbonation.\\t\\tThe flavour on this stout is great, as is the aroma which announces it, but I can't help but be somewhat disappointed by the lighter than hoped for body and the complete lack of head.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Had the pleasure of trying this out on-tap at Bodega tonight.\\t\\tCanadian Breakfast Stout is a very dark chocolate fudge color. It's damn near onyx and opaque. There are light burgundy highlights at the outermost edges, but it's very dark and ominous. A thin layer of bubbles covered the surface. They're mocha brown and dissipate quickly. Lacing was spotty and light. Perhaps a little too much abv.\\t\\tThe nose is impressive. It kicks off with an excellent mix of roasted coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate. Coffee seems fairly prominent, and it smells all the better for it in my view. Bourbon is noted, but isn't overpowering. Reminds me of KBS in that sense. That's my preferred approach with barrel aged stouts. Ancillary notes of vanilla and oak are present. A touch of maple syrup is noted, and adds quite a bit of character. More than I expected. Alcohol is present. It's big beer. If you're offended, get over it.\\t\\tI'm really impressed with Canadian Breakfast Stout. I had high expectations and they are met. Roasted coffee or espresso blends with dark, bittersweet chocolate initially. The chocolate malt base is very sturdy (and tasty). Bourbon is definitely in the mix, but definitely has a restrained taste. It's there, but isn't too bold. Good call. It complements the stout flavors very well. Secondary flavors of vanilla, oak, light molasses, and anise are noted. Maple syrup is noted throughout. It has a nice flavor and adds some character. But I don't think it improves it materially. Just my take. Alcohol is noted, but isn't warming or hot. Finishes chocolaty with a touch of bourbon.\\t\\tCanadian Breakfast Stout has a medium body that leans toward thick with warming. It's nice and smooth. Carbonation is dialed back nicely. It's good, but more body would probably improve it a little. Drinkability is excellent. This is damn tasty stuff. No question. It goes down too easy for a beer of its stature. I'll stop at one glass, but would love another.\\t\\tI really had high hopes and expectations for Canadian Breakfast Stout. Founders certainly didn't disappoint. This is great beer. Personally, I don't like it quite as much as KBS, but that's just my preference. I don't think the maple flavor adds that much. It's good though, and it certainly doesn't hurt things. More than solid-all around otherwise. If you have the opportunity to get out and try this one, you certainly should. In typical Founders fashion, it's excellent.\",\n",

A very worn, off-white patch of head is sandblasted across the top and manages to imprint a minimal number of tiny marks of lace as it sinks. Its complexion is pressed with a light haze although it shines with resilience when held into the light. This is among the most astonishing blends of colour I've witnessed in a beer.\\t\\tSweet, roasty malts and bitter, citric hops are presented as different sides of the same coin. The aroma is an illustrious display of vibrant, resinous and fruity lupullin but doesn't compromise an ounce of its thick, chewy maltiness. There's caramel and grapefruit; beers that are both *this* hoppy and *this* malty always impress me. It's like the insides of the kiln meet the fresh air of the forest. I'm already foaming at the mouth... \\t\\tThe very first sip made me start to convulse, as if I was part of a mystic, enchanting ritual where I became possessed by some sort of hop deity. (I'm not kidding, my limbs flailed!) Each following sip would prolong the trance. Notes of grain husks, toasted bread, charred grapefruit, grilled melon, pine sap and dark caramel all linger with resounding flavour. Each sip is sufficient to fill your mouth with enough flavour to last for a long period of time. \\t\\tThis may have an extra little bit of alcohol and bitterness but it's every bit as refreshing (if not more) than any of it's lower strength, lesser IBU peers. In fact, it does them one better by being more filling, too. The Belgian caramel malts really do impart a sweet richness which, right on cue, is quickly crushed by the pounding citrus of an Amarillo dry hop. This is lightly spicy, pleasantly citric, deliciously sweet, agreeably toasty and gratifyingly hoppy. \\t\\tI don't know who Red is, but I like his Rye ale. He obviously shares my affliction for hops and my taste for well crafted, well rounded beer. This offering is deserving of its reputation and then some! If only the people of Grand Rapids knew how lucky they were. And I'm lucky too; after two trades turned up infected bottles of this stuff, I have BuckeyeNation to thank for finally hooking me up with a good sample... actually, a great sample!\",\n",

Sports some of the heaviest lacing I have ever seen.

I find it highly drinkable and very well balanced. If anything, I think it needs a bit of a citrus hop kick to balance out the pine, but that's a minor quibble.

       "  'review/text': \"I had this at the Founders Taproom yesterday, as the last leg of a Midwest trip. What a great way to finish off a fun trip! Thanks to my good friend and fellow BA TCGoalie for giving me the heads up that this was available at the brewery. \\t\\tI'm always a little wary of reviewing a beer that I know is rated so highly, but this one made it easy. So tasty and enjoyable to imbibe. This review is from detailed notes. \\t\\tA: Poured almost jet-black with just a little bit of a brownish tint into a tall, thin, 12 ounce glass that was flared at the top. The head was an attractive mocha that had just about disappeared by the time the beer was brought to me. The beer left a small, dotty, sticky lacing pattern on the sides of the glass, along with a clear, thick film that coated the glass after a sip. \\t\\tS: As soon as I saw that the smaller pours of this were served in a snifter, I was a little sad that I got the tall 12 oz. glass, because it was a little more difficult to catch the full aroma. However, my girlfriend got the smaller pour a little later, so I was able to get the full effect of the smell from her pour. The main scent was a medium-bodied coffee bean. There was a nice maple sweetness that accompanied the coffee smell, and just a hint of toffee and caramel. It smelled like I imagine a Canadian household smelling at breakfast-time. \\t\\tT: Phenomenal. The rich flavor was so well balanced between the maple sweetness and the slight acidic coffee taste. The taste starts out sweet and then as the sip is finished, a slight bitter hop characteristic takes over. However the taste left in the mouth after the sip is that rich, coating maple sweetness again. Such a complex and rich flavor. Every component ingredient was perfectly proportioned to the others. \\t\\tM: Full and coating. The feel was so exciting and satisfying. The beer really disperses its flavors evenly and thickly over the palate. The carbonation was so perfect for this beer that it was almost an afterthought. \\t\\tD: Not surprisingly, this beer had a fabulous drinkability. I never thought that the sweetness of the flavor overpowered my palate, and there was no alcohol detectable. This beer was so flavorful and rich. Founders really has a good thing going with their Breakfast Stout line and I can't wait to try the Kentucky version soon!\",\n",

It has a bit of legs running down the sides of the glass as well.\\t\\tNose brings on plenty of dark malts, sweet syrups, molasses, caramel, toffee, plenty of heavy crystal malts and a bit of reddish malts, as well as some rich fruit, bit of a plum and very slight raisin, a bit biscuity, a bit of chocolate hidden way in there that comes out with some warmth, a bit of earthy hops, and hint of booze round it off. There is also a light soft aged malt aroma, delicate and hard to get, need to wait for my nose to acclimate to all the other bigger aromas first, and let it warm as well.\\t\\tTaste starts rich and very malty, again loaded with crystal malts, some light roast, a bit of chocolate too, reddish malts, little biscuit, chewy raisins and plum fruits, lots of earthy bittering hops come through now, a bit of a grassy and spicy hop flavor too, it gets fairly bitter thanks to the heavy hops, and a bit from the scorched malts I think too. It's fairly sweet and a bit syrupy, some caramel, molasses, toffee, and almost a berry fruit syrup, all come through. A bit boozy, but not too bad, some warmth and hint of boozy flavor. Finishes pretty bitter still, which seems to ramp a bit as the flavor lingers, and really comes through on the finish as the malts and sweet syrups dry, a bit of lingering dark and reddish malt flavors, bit of earthy chewy hops, and some light syrups, then a little minerality comes through. A slight bit of a coffee syrupy sticking to the mouth very late, with more lingering hop bitterness.\\t\\tMouth is a bit heavier bodied, little syrupy, some booze, and decent carbonation.\\t\\tOverall pretty good. THis has gotten better with the age as I didn't like it as much fresh, and I still think I prefer the '09, but I'll have to do a side by side later. A little boozy, but expected for 12% and nothing over the line, a little sticky but dries a bit, fairly hoppy and bitter but that's what they were going for. Not sure how well it will age long term with the hops in it, but we shall see.\",\n",

Poured the color of cola with virtually no head, just a slick of khaki-colored foam that quickly dispersed into a slick and some concentrated spots. Some lacing, but no retention. Lots of bourbon off the bottle pop, with some dark fruit and licorice revealed in the glass. Taste is consistent with nose, with a creamy/buttery quality, as well as cocoa and molasses. No fruit comes out in the flavor profile; however, a hint of vanilla also reveals itselft, with a little bit of licorice lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in consistency and silky without being oily; carbonation is subtle and light. Not a big bold BA RIS, but excellent balance, with a well-hidden abv. One of the few examples of the style that can be consumed solo. Top notch, despite the price tag. A nice beer to crack on a cold night in New England.',\n",

The cloudiness kind of intrigues me but otherwise nothing looks especially grand about this lager. The smell also provides no evidence that this beer deserves such a boastful adjective in its name - barley malt, maybe some lemony hops and honeyed sweetness. Decent, but not grand.\\t\\tThis is a fairly refreshing beer, but it's like they forgot to put the taste in. Pale grain malts with a twinge of grassy hop bitterness in the finish, which barely lingers for a second. There's some sweetness in the flavour profile but the bitterness is more prominent. Thin and watery, with heavy carbonation. Easy to throw back, and definitely tastier than most adjunct lagers.\\t\\tIt's hard to get excited about this stuff. I didn't pick up many adjunct notes, so I would at least rank this above your average macro lager. Drinkable and kinda refreshing, but not something I'm likely to get again. This one was in the OCB mix pack, and it seems like a pretty boring and questionable inclusion. Trafalgar isn't the most renowned brewery in craft circles but they definitely have more interesting, if not plainly better brews than their Grand Lager.\",\n",

Just coats the tongue enough for the malt to stick for a nice aftertaste. \\t\\tO: this is drinkable, delicious, and well crafted. It was $9 for a 6 pack in Michigan. I'll buy it again if I see it.\",\n",

I note coffee, chocolate and burnt malt, all expected and all pleasing.\\t\\tT Nice stout. All of the above mentioned smells come throught in the taste and also a tad of bitterness from distant hops. This, much like the other offerings from Ohio Brewing, has a watery endfeel which was not the greatest. All taste dissapears within about 45 seconds.\\t\\tM Nice and smooth, again as I expected and I was not let down.\\t\\tD Good for this style due to its nice smells, tastes and mouthfeel.\\t\\tNotes: This is my favorite beer from Ohio Brewing Company, an establishment that is trying their hardest but has a lot of room for improvement.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"On tap at CBC 6/5 to kick off my post ABCF brunch. This one was served in a tall thin glass.\\t\\tCambridge Brewing's Hefeweizen pours an appropriately hazy dark lemon. There's about a finger of fluffy white foam capping the beer, and it fades a little on the quick side before leaving a bit of lacing still attached to the glass. The yeasty notes jump out from the start in the nose. There's the traditional fruity banana and clove notes, but also a slight tartness that's fairly unique for the style. There's a solid (almost too much) amount of bready pilsner malt notes present as well. The flavor brings more of the same, except with a little bit of a great emphasis on the malty sweetness. It's a shame, because I *really* dig what CBC is getting out of their weizen yeast, and if it was as pronounced as some other hefes I've had, this might well be my favorite version of the style. The carbonation, always the trickier part of the mouthfeel for the style imo, is spot on. Bubbly and active, but a step short of spritzy Belgian territory. The body though, is a bit too present for me, which I guess shouldn't surprise me given how I feel about the malts in the flavor profile. I don't know if I think CBC's Hefeweizen is a little bit over-attenuated, or if the esters and phenols thrown off by the yeast just aren't powerful enough, but the result is a beer that's a slight rebalancing away from being world class.\",\n",

Low carbonation and bitterness makes the mouthfeel fine and dandy. Quite drinkable. 4.5/5\\t\\tOverall: A very interesting variation on a increasingly common style of beer.

Decent retention and some lacing left behind after dwindling down to a ring of a fine bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aromas of dark fruits (prunes, figs, raisin) mesh with earthy and herbal tobacco leaves. Layers of roastiness and chocolate liqueur also waft up. The taste brings the same load of succulent dark fruits up front, plus some concord grapes. Some of the herbal and tobacco notes add complexity on the midpalate before the finish brings out a bittersweet cocoa, cookies and biscuits, and some warming and herbal liqueur. Full bodied, slick, with a moderate yet fine carbonation. The taste both intense and outstanding, with remarkable drinkability for such a full flavored brew.

       "  'review/text': \"on tap @ Bluegrass Brewing tasting room\\t\\tPours a hazy copper color, nearly amber, with a loose head, which dissipates rather quickly, leaving just a little ring. There's a little lacing, but not much. Looks about average I'd say. The smell is primarily of maltiness - very sticky and sweet - munich malt I'd guess, but fairly dry in the smell. Nice minty hop presence, kind of slight, but still there behind the sweet caramel smells, with maybe a touch of chocolate. I don't know if I just love the noble hops on top of the sticky malt body, but this one tastes great. A nice malty backbone - caramel, butterscotch almost, nice and bready, a bit toasty. And then a beautiful minty hop presence that sticks to you and kind of washes down with a hint of lime. Low bitterness, almost no esters. This one is nicely balanced, malty, hoppy - but not American hoppy. There are both subtleties and very obvious tastes here, that are all pleasant. There's a kind of sharp bite of carbonation, maybe a bit much, accentuated by the hops. Nice body, not huge, kind of walks the line between thin and full. Maybe a tad on the thin side of medium. A good drink. Nice flavors, not too high on the ABV. Overall, a bit challenging, interesting, simple and enjoyable in varying degrees and phases. This would probably be my choice if I returned.\",\n",

I could drink more than a few of these at a time. I will definitely try this one again.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"2010 12oz bottle\\t\\tA. Red Mahogany-brown with hardly any head at all. Not surprising on the head given the beer's been aged somewhat. This has also produced some floaters, but that is only to be expected. Perhaps a shade darker than usual?\\t\\tSTM. The hops are still there! And they've held up rather nicely, although I suspect in muted versions of their former glory. However, there is this odd coconut-like smell that I find somewhat off-putting and do not remember ever encountering in the fresh bottles of this. I will have to make more aging trials on this to tell if this is a fluke or typical.\\tThe Malts are as thick and biscuity as ever, in fact amplified over fresh. There is a lot of different malt flavors, some of them bready and others funky. In fact the malt flavors are reminiscent of more of a Scotch Ale profile than an Imperial Red, although I understand that the dividing line is rather blurry sometimes.\\t\\tVerdict: I like it a lot, enough in fact that now I am going to be seeking out an entire case to stow away in the old cellar for a while and do the periodical aging trial routine. I'll add more to this review in time as I conduct the cellaring study.\",\n",

Still the nose of smoked cheese is present.\\t\\tTaste: This is a strange beer on the palette. It seems to really focus a ton of its flavor on alcohol and smoke - even though the ABV is not that high. It is almost a bit curious how this beer can showcase this much alcohol.

No freshness date found, but I was curious about the brewery location on the label. The label says O'Fallon Brewery - Steven's Point, Wisconsin. Every O'Fallon beer that I've ever tried in the past came out of O'Fallon, Missouri. Oh well.\\t\\tThe beer poured a murky caramel brown color, almost like dirty river water. It produced only a half finger of off-white head that disappeared within seconds. Not a pretty looking beer at all. Surprisingly it did leave a few spots of lacing with each sip.\\t\\tIt smells like a cheap box of chocolate covered cherries. It has more of a cocoa powder chocolate smell instead of a nice rich chocolate aroma, but there is no doubt that this is a cherry chocolate beer. The aroma is huge.\\t\\tWell, it says cherry chocolate beer and that's what you get. The problem is you get a powdered chocolate taste instead of a nice dark or milk chocolate flavor. Definite maraschino cherry flavor and perhaps some added malt for sweetness, but no trace of hops for balance at all.\\t\\tThis is surprisingly thin and watery for a chocolate beer, but the moderate to medium carbonation level seems to fit this style and is enough to make it somewhat refreshing.\\t\\tDrinkability is OK if you don't mind Tootsie Roll flavored chocolate as opposed to a good Godiva or Fanny May chocolate taste.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Appearance - Mix of amber, burnt orange and gold in color. A slightly off white head that was thick with a ton of bubbles. Well above average retention and lacing. The beer was cloudy due to being unfiltered and some yellow highlights were hanging around at the bottom. \\t\\tSmell - Very fresh, floral hops jump right out in the nose at first. A ripe grapefruit citrus breezes in after a moment. Even picking out a dry cracker like aroma. Very well balbanced and clean. Got a slight hint of a soapy smell. Just barely there. \\t\\tTaste - Strong grapefruit citrus bursts through on the first gulp. Only a touch of alcohol follows. The bitterness is very prominent, but in a good way. A clean malty sweetness, maybe caramel, rounds out the flavor. Very good in my opinion. \\t\\tMouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Dry and crisp. covers the palate in a very thorough way, leaving a lot behind. A bit of alcohol \"heat\" makes the mouthfeel most enjoyable. \\t\\tDrinkability - A very good and enjoyable IPA. It\\'s easily drinkable and worth a try in my opinion. I could easily make a night out of this even with the higher ABV. Probably couldnt\\' do this two nights in a row, but definitely a brew I wouldn\\'t turn down if it was offered.',\n",

Quite fruity with apples, peaches, pears, appricots, mangos, and other lighter and more tropical fruits. These further emphasize the sugary base beer.\\t\\tAs expected, the beer's body is heavier and sweeter than found in most Belgian Pales.

This was going to be an extra but not having had it, I figured Id sample and pick up another for the trade. Im thinking twice about sending this one out. \\t\\tLight coca and some powdery sugar are in here. A touch of vanilla and oak round out of the flavors.

       "  'review/text': 'For my first official BA review, I\\'m choosing the Founders Curmudgeon. Why? I have no idea. Ever since my middle school hay days I have loved the word, Curmudgeon - although at the time I was rather oblivious to its meaning, and merely fond of the similarly titled Nirvana B-side. \\t\\tFor quite some time in my beer loving days I had searched high and low for this beer. I worked to set up a number of trades to pick just one up to try, each inevitably falling dead in their own tracks. Then one day, as if the gods themselves had been watching my search, it just showed up. And I\\'m not talking about a trip to Grand Rapids I took in search of the beer (to no avail), nor stops on the same trip to handfuls of local Michigan beer stores (again to no avail), and I\\'m not even talking about a happen-chance finding of a single bottle in the back room of a store no one would have ever thought to find the brew. No. I mean it just showed up. Seriously - right now, it\\'s all over Cincinnati. I mean everywhere. How about that for serendipitous notion? But hey, I\\'m not complaining! And either way, it showed up, and then it found its way into my cellar - from the looks of it by the truckload at that.\\t\\tBut I digress. I poured this beer before even navigating to the review page here on BA and my taste buds are getting impatient. It is worthy to note that I have poured my Curmudgeon at cellar temperature into a deep stemless white wine glass - my glass of choice of lately for enjoying anything as particularly malty as this.\\t\\tThis beer pours a beautiful, deep red mahogany, and quickly gathers a finger and a half of light brown head. The head dissipates a little too quickly, but leaves an amoeba of lacing griping tight to the glass. There is a touch of standing sediment hanging out in the beer, but nothing to frown upon for this style.\\t\\tThe smell! This one knocks in with some thick, boozy notes that are backed up by caramel, molasses, deep grape, and, although I can\\'t touch what this particular flavor is, I will describe the overall smell as \"burnt sticky caramel corn.\" I am fighting the urge to find the correct words to describe this beer with my desire to toss this one down the hatch. And in that case... bottoms up!\\t\\tBurnt Sticky Caramel Corn is pretty accurate if you ask me! The Old Curmudgeon hits the tongue with a quickly waning hit of fresh hops, grazes the tongue gracefully through its candy-like mid-body and rushes down the back of the throat almost like it wasn\\'t even there. This one sits on the tongue after finish and simply bubbles for a while, asking for another sip. The sweetness sits with a light glaze through the mouth and reaffirms my newly coined burnt sticky caramel corn flavor profile. Plus some plum... yeah, a little bit of plum. Once it goes down, though, it\\'s like I\\'m breathing fire here. Not like some crazy burn-down-the-house fire; more like a sitting by the campfire making s\\'mores (s\\'more what?) fire. The booze sits nicely and keeps the warming coming quite nicely. I could take this one out in 40 degree weather in shorts and a t-shirt and keep warm. I like that.\\t \\tAs much as I really like this beer, I\\'d love to have a little more variety in flavor aside from the aforementioned notes. For what is there, however, I can certainly appreciate the flavors, and there is nothing about this one that says, you can\\'t have just one. On a good night with some good company, I could sip on these for quite some time. Well worth the wait to finally try these, and I am more than appreciative that I had quite a few more of these in my cellar.\\t\\tCheers!',\n",

It reminds me of a Tripel Karmeliet with a much stronger lemon presence. The lemon zest almost completely covers up every other taste in the beer it seems. In the aftertaste a bit of coriander peeks its head out, along with a bit of a wheat malt bite. The hops are well hidden, but their presence is also detected through the bitter feel. It is still good, but it could be MUCH better without so much acidic citrusy flavor.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp and has a bit of a sting to it from the carbonation, the citric flavor, the hops, and what seems to be wheat malt(?).\\t\\tDrinkability is quite good. I am glad to have such a beer waiting for me after my walk home from work on such a hot summer's night.

Bready taste with lemony notes, modestly bitter finish, no real aftertaste. Bland, inoffensive, which is probably why Carling has been the best-selling British lager for such a long time. Much better on tap, or in the bottle, than from the can - I got to say! Properly chilled, this is easy-drinking blond beer, but nothing you'd actively choose if there are other blond beers available. Still, every time when I'm in the UK and keen on a light-tasting beer, this is what I order. But from the cask! I hate canned beers.\",\n",

The head begins to attach itself to the glass in large chunks as it recedes into a rocky cap. Despite the sticky head, the lace that the body produces sticks sparingly. The body is a light yellow, pale gold color and very, very clear. Minimal visible carbonation.\\t\\tS: Awful. Smells like a prophylactic. That\\'s right, this beer smells like a condom. WTF? Heavily phenolic with aromas of heated rubber. Underneath all that mess were malts of grain, hay and straw plus dried herb scented hops. \\t\\tT: A much needed improvement from the nose. Only the malts and hops come through, plus a white pepper spiciness. Still, not great.\\t\\tM: The body is a little thin and on the lighter side. Average carbonation and a moderately bitter finish. Flavor duration is just a bit longer than short. Crisp, clean and refreshing as a pilsner should be.\\t\\tD: The low ABV would certainly allow for all day imbibement, so in that regard, Pilsner Urquell gets a 5.0 for drinkability. On the other hand, \"Do I want another?\" No thank you, I\\'ll pass. So in this regard, Pilsner Urquell gets a 2.0. Average of these two scores sticks.',\n",

Chocolate and coffee and small hints of vanilla. Dark fruits, sweet plumbs mostly. Bourbon overtakes everything. \\t\\tThe taste is fairly hot. Bourbon just takes the stage and steals the show. Coffee flavors are not as present as I wanted them to, chocolate is also a very large character. The chocolate in this is more sweet bakers chocolate rather than earthy chocolate malt flavor. The bourbon is not smooth like Bourbon County, it is a bit more rough on the palate and interferes with some of the other flavors. When it warms up to room temperature the vanilla character comes out. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel is great because I personally love a bourbon mouthfeel, hot and intense.

It did travel cross-country but then again several other beers did and they still poured perfectly. Smell is of hops, alcohol (but only a little) and a strong sweet caramel. Smells like a Barleywine. Taste is good. Taste is of hops and nothing but hops. At times there is a bit of a malt backbone that tries to make an appearance with a bit of caramel but the hops beat it down. A thick, oily, and warming sensation as it does down. Overall this is a very well crafted beer. I have to say I've had several beers that have a much lower ABV where I notice the alcohol more. I've heard people debate on what catagory this beer should be in. As for a DIPA or Barleywine I really dont know. All I know is that this beer has a hell of a kick to it and you should drink this warmer and a bottle should last you about 2 hours or so. Sip and enjoy!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'An already failed effort as far as the appearance goes. Firstly, there is no head retention (incredibly uncharacteristic of an oatmeal stout). Any minimal, trace amount of head (formed only off a stiff pour and lasting only seconds) was a hardly tarnished shade, closest to the colour white. \\t\\tSecondly, the body is far from opaque; the entire bottom third of the glass glimmering chestnut brown. To the light one can actually spot their finger on the other side. None of the above mentioned should be true of an oatmeal stout. \\t\\tThe aroma is in fact smoky, lightly anyhow. It posses no depth and became considerably off putting in short time. Most of the \"smoke\" is actually roast, the source of which is almost certainly only roasted barley. One dimensional aroma with no real pleasantries. There is some hint to grapes (by which is meant \"purple stuff\"), cherries and chocolate, but all on an artificial level. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel has some element of roast (which I suppose was intended to be the \\'smoke\\'). It finishes with a terribly dry note that feels as if is choking the back of the throat. Extremely little carbonation. Little bitterness - a feeble and meek body with no weight to it. So light bodied, how can this be called \\'stout\\'? \\t\\tIt seems to leave you more thirsty, with an urge for something to rinse the taste out of your mouth. The mouthfeel is artificially ashy with no dimension. No flavour lingers, only the unpleasant ash-like dryness. \\t\\tIn trademark Trafalgar fashion, the flavours all seem artificial. There is suggestion of dark, lightly roasted malts. I might guess this as an attempt at a Belgian Dark Ale. There is a light note of dried fruits and some smoky character but these are syrupy and astringent. I find myself wondering if perhaps this is what the liquid at the bottom of empties filled with cigarette buts tastes like... \\t\\tNo, it does not feel good bashing the beer like this. No, it does not feel good putting a brewery down like this. But in being truthful and objective, I\\'ve consistently found their beers to be of poor quality. As with many (most) Trafalgar releases this was: under carbonated, possessed a syrupy/astringent flavour, and overall, was simply a poor, poor representation of the style.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"This beer is just too over the top for my tastes. This is clearly more of a liqueur along the Gran Marnier line, or perhaps an aggressively hopped up version of a barley wine is an apt description, but as a double IPA, this is just too much. I do not care for the throaty alcohol burn and prefer instead beers that mask their rather high ABV. At 13%, maybe that is asking too much. The beer pours a ruby brown, with a sticky and syrupy consistency, minimal lacing, no head, no retention. The smell is the best part and outstanding in its own right. The aroma is intense brown sugars, caramel, liqueur, thick syrupy malts, and heavy fruits of the fig and raisin variety. The taste is just overpowered by the alcohol, but underneath it all you will find a pretty hopped up beer, and intense brown sugar malts, caramels, and liqueur ... lots of it. This is a thick and full bodied beer with quite a throaty aftertaste that will requires some neutralization before trying anything else. I would suggest drinking this one last in any beer tasting session. good luck with this one. I don't think I can finish it. It truly is a sipping beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12 oz. brown twisty bottle. Nothing out of the ordinary here.\\t\\tAppearance: Served into a snifter. Pours cola brown with a tan rocky head. No light gets through this beer. Looks very American stout/porter-like with some cool cascades up the side of the snifter.\\t\\tSmell: A mix of light citrus hops, maybe some wheat bread, a hint of yeast, and maybe some vanilla bean. Very intriguing and complex. \\t\\tTaste: Some initial hop bitterness that's quickly balanced out by some wheat and coffee undertones, and then it finishes with some piney hops and just a glimpse of the alcohol. Reminds me of a hoppy porter or a mix between a pale ale and a porter. Very interesting and I can't say I've had anything like it before. It's hoppy enough to satisfy the hop lover but balanced so it doesn't destroy your palate.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium bodied and lively due to the carbonation. \\t\\tDrinkability: Wow! This one really works for me. I haven't explored too many rye beers because the image I get is chewing on a big piece of dry rye bread. Not the case! This would be great for the spring/fall/winter months on a cloudy day. Great balance of hops and malts (though definitely leaning towards hops) and big enough to pair with a nice steak.\\t\\tStrongly recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"A rather assertive hop attack that is surprisingly drinkable around a not so assertive body, and a nicely integrated alcohol level.\\t\\tPresentation: 22 oz brown capped bottle. Label pivoting around the image of a standing/hopping frog holding a jar of beer. On a first distant look the label is forgivable, and given its sad craftsmanship it deserves some kudos for that. But if one pays any kind of minimal attention this is another terribly design label with at least 4 different fonts in an awful array with even worse blending and color effects. It's so ugly that it is almost cute. Luckily not all craft brewers take this care with their branding... Side paragraphs offer a general description of the brew, and intent. Lacks any bottling or freshness date (Although for whatever is worth this bottle was taken right of the case as it was distributed today to DC). Notes Alc. by Vol. (8.2%), IBUs (168), FG (26), and OG (84). Served in a tulip glass. \\t\\tA - Deep amber pour, remotely hazy if at all, nice creamy head with good retention, a nice surface memory and lacing.\\t\\tS - Richly hoppy... It sure is not shy, but it is not an extremely assertive brew. Grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, with malty caramel. Nice and cogent.\\t\\tT - Firmly hoppy with an initial flavor that only bursts with a rich bitterness as it hits the end of the palate. Hold by a nice and subtle malty sweetness, the citrus and pineapple touches prevail with a persistent presence. \\t\\tM - Mouthfeel is medium even medium-light at points, with adequate carbonation. For such a supposedly hoppy brew a somewhat lighter, and yet solid body makes it have an unusual and very efficient flow. \\t\\tD - Dangerously quaffable. It does not show the high alcohol of other DIPAs but it is not shy either and it offers a deceptively drinkable profile for those attracted to hoppy brews.\\t\\tNotes: Hmmm, all in all this is a pretty nice hoppy brew. It is not the wild brew that some would have one believe, but it is very solid. Also, this may have rocked my world a year or two ago? But if, like it seems to be the case, one builds up quite the tolerance and taste for hops maybe it is me that feels it far more gentle in the palate than what this typically is for others? All in all this is quite a recommendable brew for hop lovers with only one big, albeit forgivable, flaw, its disastrous brand design.\",\n",

Tastes very clean and more malty-sweet than the aroma suggests. Sweetness quickly gives way to strong hop flavors and bittering, as promised by the nose.

However, it had the Trafalgar lighthouse cap on it, so I'm unsure if this beer or the Old Mill has been bought out. Seeing as the Old Mill Elora ale is retired, I'll post my review here. Comes out a ruby/blood red with a very small amount of foam. Smells very sweet. Plenty of fruits and berries, with some bready malts and toffee. Taste starts out with an overbearing sweetness. Dark fruits, berries, caramel and toffee just overpowers the palate, making me wonder if it would be more tolerable if served cold. Ends a bit bitter, with some grassy and earthy hops, with a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel is light bodies and somewhat oily. Starts out too sweet for me to consider it drinkable. I may try it again at a colder temperature, but I believe that if a beer needs to be served ice cold, then it's probably not that good a beer. Overall, not to my liking. If you like sweets, though, give it a try.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Presentation: Standard 12 ounce brown glass bottle sealed with a simple brass colored crown cap. One main black label (which differs from that shown on BA) has a picture of a cranky looking carved pumpkin face with orange text which refers to this as Pumpkin Ale. Bottom of the label states that this isbrewed with Pumpkin and Spices (Cinnamon Sticks, Nutmeg and Cloves). No strength or freshness dates.\\t\\tAppearance: Great presentation. Lightly hazed burnished copper body reflects the incandescent light with a refractive prowess forming orange-brown rays. Big off-white head on the pour but this soon settles down to a thin but consistently resilient &#8539; thick head. Smattered lacing with a healthy carbonation, which reinstates the head thickness when gently swirled.\\t\\tNose: Massive punch of cloves, background is full of cinnamon, nutmeg, mixed Christmas spices and a warming aspect, but its all in order and under control. As it breathes the strength middles out and remains at a level that is appealing and never annoying.\\t\\tTaste: Feels like it starts more with toasted malts than any Pumpkin, though that may have just been my taste buds fooled by the first mouthful. After that a nicely balanced mix of Cinnamon, Nutmeg add a spiced feel adds to the more juicy squashed Pumpkins. Finishes with plenty of spices and a gentle malt sweetness. Lingers on the palate for a while. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Has a healthy feel, but the depth of the textures seems a tad thin at times, or just above average at others. It seems to swing between the two and lend an overall light bodied feel. If there are any nit picks with this brew it is the fact that it probably has a bit too much of a watery nature to it. \\t\\tDrinkability: Im not one to ever pound a few Pumpkin Ales, even the ones I like, but I could certainly manage a couple of 12 ounce bottles of this one and it has a more appealing Drinkability than most. \\t\\tOverall: I sometimes shudder when I see Pumpkin Ales, often they are killed by the excessive use of all things Halloween, or worse, they turn out to be lame duck Amber Ales with a feint hint of nothing. OFallons offering is one of those that gets the balance just right for me. A solid offering and a good example of what I think a Pumpkin Ale should be.\\t\\tCheers for this one Joe.

The more I sip, the more the strawberry and apricot flavors take center stage. It has an appropriate hop finish that really balances it out. It lacks some of the yeasty spice and funkiness that is found in many Belgian ales. ABV is well integrated, but makes itself known when sliding down my belly.\\t\\tBody is medium, with a slick and smooth mouthfeel made light and airey by the high level of carbonation.

A short, creamy tan head disappears quickly. Lacing is sparse.\\t\\tIf the Founders guys have mastered one thing, it appears to be the aromas they can coax from their ingredients. The KBS is legendary...This porter is fantastic as well. Lots of roasted malt fills the room, not just your nostrils. It's everywhere...It smells like a cup of espresson, some dark chcolate and some fresh baked french bread all mixed together at once. I also get some cinnamon, a hint of molasses and a tiny faint hint of barrel-aging. Fabulous.\\t\\tUm, holy cow wow! The flavor is...it's unreal...It's certainly a porter, but it's smoother. The initial hint is a blazing whip of malt tang - chocolate and espresso backing it up. But it quickly rounds out into something else. It's like a morning cup of coffee and a chocolate doughnut, but without too much, if any, sugar. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but not billowing or thin. It helps to enhance the flavors. Alcohol is masked completely, by the way. Finish is a wonderful mix of hops and chocolate covered espresso (not beans, just the espresso)...Long and bitter and excellent. An elite ale...I can hardly find fault in it. Like the Darkest Era album, it's fantastic and worth tracking down at all costs.\\t\\tWhat I like most: Pretty much everything.\\t\\tWhat I like least: Almost nothing, I can find fault only in that I'd like a slightly bigger, fuller head.\\t\\tVerdict: World class version: unique, smooth, rich and wonderful.

The head is short and lasts a short while. It is pink in color with small bubbles and what appears to be carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. The beer is a deep magenta and has some opacity to it. What a great change from all these other conventional beers.\\t\\tSmell: Raspberries, raspberries, raspberries. Freshly picked raspberries. There are other aromas like strawberry and plum in there but raspberry is clearly the dominat aroma. This could easily be a lambic with some brett added to it.\\t\\tTaste: Tart and sweet. The raspberry flavor is in full effect. This is a great representation on the flavor of the berry. It's not supposed to be overly sweet like jam but it hold true to the natural sugars that are present in the fruit. No hop flavor to speak of and some maltiness. This is so refreshing.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Crisp and clean. I was shocked to look up and see the ABV is 6.9%. You could have told me it was 3% and I would have been a believer. Very cunningly crafted! \\t\\tDrinkability: I believe this is an awesome beer. I would get a case of this if I saw it. I love raspberry and think that the brewers made it authentic to the flavor that the berry holds. The ABV is well-hidden and the beer is sickeningly drinkable and quenching.

Dirty Bastard just might get me to reconsider this practice by default.\\t\\tDirty Bastard pours a rich, muddy-brown body with ruby highlights, topped by a finger of mocha head, really impressive; decent lacing on the glass doesn't hurt, either. The nose is fine, with lots of malt, some chocolate, coffee and caramel, and an understated but nonetheless present roasted aroma--good.\\t\\tThe taste is excellent--lots of flavors mentioned above, but very smooth, and better as it warms a little here by the laptop at the table. There is also some fruit detectable, perhaps some apple or pear. Excellent taste. I was hoping for a little more carbonation to allow for more felicitous access to the flavors, but this isn't bad. The smooth texture does much to convey the flavor, while also minimizing the high ABV (8.3%) to make this heavy gem all the more accessible. \\t\\tThis made a believer out of me, and there's not much like being refracted in one's opinion because of the willingness to try a beer or style. Such is the case with Dirty Bastard, as it was thankfully due to my friend Captain Pat's intervention with the Southern Tier IPA. Good show, Founders!\",\n",

I really like the way this one smells. \\t\\tT-Maple is again subtle which is good. Playing with maple can be tricky I am sure as a bigger dose can clearly make the beer cloying and tough to drink. That is not a problem here. The maple is evident and lends a sweet flavor to the beer but it does not override things. Also has some nutty characteristics.\\t\\tM-Remarkably clean...a bit light in the shorts but at 4.6% I expected a lighter to medium bodied beer. Still, I think just a little bigger body would really make this beer special. After drinking a few, I'd call it light bodied rather than medium light.\\t\\tD-Another exciting seasonal from this upstart brewpub. This is a clean, well made maple ale.

However, it was early afternoon by that point...\\t\\tReceived this one in a trade with brewCzar - thanks for the hook-up!\\t\\tPoured into a Westvleteren chalice. Very little head with just a hoola-hoop of tan foam. Very dark and viscous with a small amount of nice lace.\\t\\tThe smell of this thing almost knocked me over at first. It took me quite a while to place the specific coffee smell in there but I finally got it. When you\\'ve left your pot of coffee on the fire in hunting camp all day, all of the water has evaporated, you just have that \"sludge\" at the bottom...if you\\'ve ever stuck your nose in there, then you know what I\\'m talking about. That deep, strong, coffee sludge smell. There\\'s also a bit of vanilla and some dark cherries in there as well, but the hunting camp sludge is out in front - and it is wonderful!\\t\\tSo much more impressed with the taste of this than I remember! As anticipated, I got smacked with a lot of coffee on the front, but this beer is much more complex than that. The chocolate in the middle was very pronounced as well...almost a milk chocolate as opposed to dark. By the third drink, I was stuck on the bourbon taste - right there on the back of the tongue. This was probably the most impressive part of the beer. The bourbon was very strong, but in a very positive way - it really stuck with me long after I\\'d finished the drink. If you like bourbon, I have full confidence that you will be impressed with the way it is incorporated in this brew! The beer was not alcoholic either - impressively smooth.\\t\\tThis beer is nearly as thick as it looks. It coats the mouth and lingers around long after the beer is gone. Outstanding.\\t\\tOverall, I was extremely impressed with the KBS. I have six more sitting in my basement and look forward to keeping those around for a few years. Definitely a beer that I\\'ll always have on hand!\\t\\tConsumed - 11/24/2009',\n",

It was the color of hay that glistened in the sun. It produced a fluffy cloud like head that was pure white in color and thick, full and sticky. The lace that was produced was the same color and very plentiful, sticky and lasted to  glass. The aromas were mostly of 2 kinds of hops: Czechoslovakian and Saaz. These hops produced a light fruit and flowery aroma all through out the bottle and glass, but as it warmed, a hint of sweet malt did rise and become noticeable. The tastes were very much like the aroma: Czechoslovakian and Saaz hops ruled, but other flavors did arise. Light tastes of grass, malt, grains and spice also were noticeable. It finished with a dry hop flower taste on the tongue that was noticeable even when I exhaled. It was light bodied. A fairly dry beer that was crisp and clean. Not overly hoped but enough to satisfy. Good balance of flavors to represent the style. Quenched my thirst and satisfied me.',\n",

A thin, fizzy head lasted for a few moments, then faded into a few lingering bubbles. The aroma consisted of roasted chocolate malts, nuts, and a bit of light piney hops sitting in the background. The flavor was slightly biting, and bitter at the start. Then it was followed up by some chocolate and coffee notes that lingered. The mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and medium-bodied. This was a pretty good brew from Founders. It almost reminded me of a dry stout. Worth a try.',\n",

Pours a deeply hazy, copper-amber with some slight pinkish-grapefruit skin tinges and a foamy off-white head extremely dense yet small, formed of minute bubbles. Lacing is left all the way down the glass. Aroma of light citrus (grapefruit, oranges, lemons) and an odd, almost dirty/soily, mineral-like yeastiness. Dont find any roasted notes, though they refer to roasted Belgian barley in the description. Malts are lightly grainy, touch biscuity at best, with no caramel sweetness. Flavor begins with dry grapefruit notes, light biscuit malt and that same earthy/soily, dusty (hard to describe it exactly) note, that is quite pervasive. Little sweet malt to be had, though the substantial, unfiltered texture provides support for the hop flavor, and moderate bitterness. Light notes of pale grains, malt husks and b-vitamin rich yeast. Centennial hops are quite distinctive in the flavor, reminds me much of Andrews Golden ale from Maine in that regard (that uses cascades/centennial when the amarillos arent available). But far less juicy, fruity amarillo influence than I would expect. As it warms, a honeyish malt flavor grows and better balances the dry, dusty, earthy notes, as well as the citrusy hops. Body is medium, with a very tight carbonation creating almost a frothy texture. No alcohol apparency, hop flavor lingers.',\n",

As it warmed, the shocking sweetness calmed down a bit that actually made it less of a fun beer. \\t\\tThe hops put up a battle against the malts, tangy molasses and eventually poke their head out for a howdya do.\\tMay be due to the color of this one, but Im left with the flavor of dried and some fresh cranberries over anything else toward the end of the glass.\\t\\tM: Thick and creamy that left a chewy mouth coating.

Probably my most favorite trader ever.. no shit.\\t\\tPoured into a big balloon wine glass.. good head and lace.. the brew is a crystal clear amber... pretty.. \\t\\tThe nose is nice and very balanced.. caramel with toasty malts.. once it warms up a tad, there is a bunch more wood and vanilla blossom\\t\\tMore \"English\" than American for sure.. fruity esters really are present with some toffee and perhaps too much lite caramel.. a really firm pale malt essence is present from the beginning to the end... the wood is much more \"American\".. slightly tannic and just enough vanilla.. The body seems a tad light.. maybe the carbonation is a touch high.. but the flavors and the aromas are very very pleasing... Sam seemed to think that I was being to hard on this one.. ehhh.. maybe.. This is actually a 750 that I could probably finish over a couple of hours and never really feel sorry for not sharing.. it takes some time to really open up.\\t\\tThanks Dan for the incredible trades...

       "  'review/text': \"22 oz. bomber bottle that has the same picture as every other Hoppin' Frog label, a happy smiling hopping frog toasting a pint of beer. Since this is a wheat ale, all the mugs of beer on the label have a yellow colored liquid inside them. Not only does this label have all the usual stuff (Government warning, address, barcode, etc), but it also has a wealth of information. On the right side it has a nice sized paragraph talking about the style and the beer itself and just below that it is where they list the beer's specifications of 6.0% ABV, 58 OG, 14 FG, and 12 IBU. Don't waste your time looking for any kind of date because Hoppin Frog doesn't date their bottles. \\t\\tAppearance: When poured into a Weizen glass, this Wild Frog was a hazy straw color that was mixed in a dash of lemon yellow coloring. It had the usual Hefeweizen tall head of white foam to it. Like every other Hefeweizen, when it receded it left behind a small white film and streaks of white lace around the glass.\\t\\tSmell: It had a nice ripe banana aroma to it. That ripe banana stuck out as the main aroma of this beer. There's was only a few other aromas behind that and that was a dash of pepper, a few cloves, a pinch of malted wheat, and a touch of citrus fruits and hops. Basically it had a standard Hefeweizen aroma to it, but that ripe banana really stood out.\\t\\tTaste: I just couldn't get excited over the taste of this beer. There wasn't much to it. The taste was one big mixture of malted wheat, banana, yeast, lemon zest, orange spice, and lightly bitter citrus hops. Not one flavor stood out as being more than average. The taste was stnadard and average at best.\\t\\tMouthfeel: It was crispy and light like the Hefeweizen style is suppose to be, but I thought the aftertaste was far too light. The aftertaste was that of malted wheat, citrus hops, and a small touch of banana.\\t\\tDrinkability: I can't say alot about this beer because there wasn't alot to this beer. I've said this before and I'm going to say it again, it's just a standard American Hefeweizen. There are better and shall I say cheaper alternatives to this one. One is more than enough for me.\",\n",

A great malt entry of toffee, chewy caramel, chocolate covered raisins, dates, and chewy oatmeal cookies gives way to a dry, earthy note of green herbs and buttery hops. Nuanced, but not overly complex.\\t\\tBody is just medium, perhaps a wee bit too slight for the flavor payload. The mouthfeel is silky and chewy with a smooth and creamy texture.

There is also some sourness from the rye, in the same way that rye bread is sour tasting ( which is a good, very good sourness ), and much caramel. This is basically an AIPA with the addition of rye malt - which has the effect of both increasing the spiciness of the hops ( the Amarillo being the perfect choice ), and of providing a pleasant mild rye sourness to the malt - both at the same time.

       "  'review/text': \"Put on the spot to order a beer quickly, a quick gander at the cooler revealed a beer I'd never had before with a label that read KBS. OK, I'll have that. DOH!!! Once delivered to me I realized that it was Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founder's. I'd had it before, but the label was different. So, OK, I was having brunch and coffee and bourbon and stout seemed appropriate, and this is a beer that can stand up to (actually dominate over) a spicy mushroom enchilada. What I was not prepared for was the price... $12!!! Damn, if only I'd known.\\t\\tAnyway, I'm sure there are a million reviews for this out there, so I'll keep it simple. I prefer the Breakfast Stout. I think that the Bourbon just adds a bit too much to the mix, and it clearly increases the perception of alcohol, whether there's more there or not. It also cuts down on the really nice coffee flavor that the standard Breakfast Stout has, and I think, the malt flavors as well.\\t\\tWhat's nice about the Breakfast Stout is that it's really complex, but that's kind of lost in the KBS because the Bourbon characteristic cuts through a lot of it (at least at the end of the glass).\\t\\tSo although this is not a beer I'd throw out of bed (you know what I mean), it's just not quite as good as the beer that spawned it.\\t\\tOh, and I kind of have to ding it for points on the appearance as the head drops immediately, and it leaves little lacing.\\t\\tCheers!\",\n",

Overall a very drinkable pale, more in the West Coast tradition than other Ontario APA's (Tankhouse, Black Oak, Durham). Trafalgar has done a good job of applying an original concept - unfiltered, wet-hopped pale ale - to fill a void in the Ontario market. Keep brewing beers like this one!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This, the fifth beer brewed exclusively for the Kentucky Liquor Barn retailers under the Sheltowee series. Consider this beer to be KBS Light.\\t\\tThis stout pours as expected from most well-brewed stouts. Poured from the growler, the onxy black beer builds a creamy, froathy tan head in a most gentlemanly fashion. Light on lace, but the head reduces to a delicate creme before holding firm through the remainder of the session.\\t\\tWhere roast aromas are expected with stouts, this coffee stout borrows a bolder and more masculine coffee roast to accompany that of roasted barley, malted milk and burnt caramels. With low level of sweetness and hops buried deep within, the nose is all about French pressed coffee and complementing roast.\\t\\tFlavors even further tilt toward the coffee with flavors of dark French roast, walnuts, roasted barley, and charred toast. Malty flavors (aside from roast) contribute only a timid malted milk taste that gives support to the roast and coffee but without competing for attention- similar to how the balance of Guiness behaves. Bitterness from roast and that from hops add layers of complexity and is hardly distinguishable- with each sip, one seems of hop bitterness and the next from coffee. No fruitiness, spiciness, or other flavors distract from the coffee focus. Lightly acidic throughout for added complexity.\\t\\tMedium creaminess early fades quickly towards a roasty finish with an everso slight sourness or grain deriven astringency. The beer lightens considerably late for a highly drinkable stout despite the intensity of coffee and roast flavor. As the beer intensifies in bitterness and acidity in aftertaste, the memory of coffee lingers well into the next sip.\\t\\tUndoubtedly another well-made beer in the Sheltowee line. While I appreciate the discipline with the coffee spice, I would welcome a bit more complexity, caramel flavor/sweetness, or actual malt taste. Regardless, the use of well-make coffee and in appropriate usage makes this a highly drinkable beer.',\n",

The lacing is really sticky and appears in the form of small dots and long vertical streaks. There are some interesting bubbles developing in the film left on top of the beer.\\t\\tS: Many separate, but cogent aromas drift out of the glass. Big malty aromas of dark chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar fight for the spotlight with piney and grapefruit hops, as well as the presence of anise and maple syrup. (Is this one brewed in maple barrels?) Also, my nose twinges with alcoholic heat every sniff I take. \\t\\tT: This is really confusing my palate. It is very sweet and tangy right off the bat, with some astringent chocolate flavors, but it also has an undercurrent of strongly bitter hops nipping at the back of my tongue and sides of the palate. The aftertaste is a mixture of sweeter citrus flavor on the tip of my tongue and dry grapefruit right on the middle of my tongue. \\t\\tM: Nemesis '10 has a cloying medium feel with a strong bite and dry finish. \\t\\tD: The high a.b.v. is not very noticeable in the taste, which certainly helps its drinkability.

This is a kolsch that is flavored with fruit not a fruity beer. It is a good mix so the fruit doesn't overpower the beer. The head also helps make it really creamy. As you drink more and the head goes away the creamyness also subsides.

The smoke is certainly the dominant flavor; a bit more than I would be ideal, actually. No real malt flavors there, though there is almost a citric, acidic tartness to it that lets you know you're drinking a weizen. Slightly bitter finish. The body is light with a fair amount of carbonation. A nice, very interesting beer, though I think I prefer the Maerzen.\",\n",

Initially, after a few sips, a bit of lacing was left, but it was pretty insubstantial, and it slowly worked its way down the inside of the glass. The beer has an attractive amber hue, and when held up to the light the orange highlights are quite nice. For me,the beer has a more earthy hop aroma than citrus, or pine. It is not bad, but it isn't a bright fresh smell, more earthy (as I repeat myself), or funky. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this beer, I enjoy funk. The flavor pretty much mirrored the aroma, but with the malts adding a nice sweet graininess that balanced the bitterness quite nicely. Considering the style and abv, I thought the mouthfeel was really quite good, medium full? smooth, with enough carbonation to keep it lively, but still quite easy to drink. 8% does not a session make, but Hop-A-Lot is really easy (and enjoyable) to drink.\",\n",

Excellent lacing all around the glass as you drink this bad boy. Smell was quite interesting: once again I utilized my mom's nose to better distinguish it and she nailed it: smells smoky, but it has a distinct Greek olive smell. Those big Greek olives you get on your salad. Since I don't really like that smell, I had to knock it down a bit. Taste was fantastic - chocolatey, smokey, raisins, and black black coffee. Definitely not a taste for the faint-hearted. Mouthfeel was the strongest feature - creamy, smooth, and soft all the way down your throat. This isn't a session beer, but with its abv, I'd probably order two or three, especially on tap. Don't pass this one up, gents.\",\n",

This entry pours a straight obsidian with only an imitation of Tim Tebow's hazing-induced haircut done in brown bubbles serving as a head. The nose is fairly weak, comprising chocolate, a hint of whiskey, a woodchip of oak, and some dry coffee beans. The taste holds notes of coffee, dark chocolate, Coca-Cola, molasses, and cinnamon. The bourbon, if actually there, is too weak to come through for me. But, at least what did show up performed nicely. The body is a surprising medium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel. Overall, this was a highly disappointing stout, especially after the enjoyment associated with the Jefferson's Reserve offering. It's quite a bit too light, the nose is weak, and the bourbon doesn't shine through very well. It doesn't taste bad, thankfully, but it's nowhere near great.\",\n",

There's a distinct sent of a smoky fire burnt berch, arcid thick smoke. The inital taste of tart and sweet bananas and sour tabacco. Velvet body with a bit of zip and lasting flavor that coats your lips and mouth. I wasn't to sure if I would like the beer by the sent, but surprisingly like Schnider in esters. The mixture of bananas , cloves and smoke just make your mouth water. It would try it with fried plantanes or grilled corn.\",\n",

I was lucky enough to get a 3-4 oz sample in a pint glass. Not sure how the beer was bottled.\\t\\tA: Black color with a meager tan head. Retention was average and there was little lacing. I'm sure it would have looked better if it wasn't the last pour from the bottle.\\t\\tS: Really elegant mixture of aromas. Nothing dominated and what was there mixed well. Roasted coffee, plenty of woodiness, chocolate and sweet crystal malts. Didn't get a lot of maple syrup, but it was there.\\t\\tT: Taste for the most part follows the nose. Coffee, wood, chocolate, and sweet malts with touch of maple.\\t\\tM: Heavy medium body with carbonation on the low side. Super smooth. There's some alcohol in there, but it doesn't interfere with the taste, rather it lends a nice warming aftertaste.\\t\\tD: Exceptional brew. Wish I could have had more.

I am currently a wine consultant but, I have several years of beer tasting experience. I guess that I have tried well over 100 beers, not including macro brews. The hype in the beer world is no different than the hype in the wine world so, I have to rip on this fairly overrated beer:\\t\\tA: pours a slightly oily black stew with no head.\\t\\tS: smells like mesquite wood, fresh ground coffee and dark chocolate. No bourbon aromas to be found.\\t\\tT: Bitter sweet espresso shot cold. Long finish. Hate to say it but, it tastes just like a can of Starbucks Double Shot Espresso with less sugar and no cream. Not as boozy as a Bourbon County Stout as I thought it would be. Where\\'s the bourbon?\\t\\tM: Not as cloying as I thought it would be. Palate is on the medium body side and dryer than I thought it would be which is good.\\t\\tD: One in the morning or one at night. Good with smoked cheese.\\t\\tBoth beer and movies have their \"fan boys\" (you know, the kind that love eye candy movies like The Matrix and Star Wars and will give movies like that a high rating simply because they are supposed to like it), and this beer will be praised by biased drinkers and will try to tell you it is the best thing ever. I disagree, this is truly an overrated beer but, it\\'s not bad. For the price, Yeti and Storm King are a much better value and you don\\'t have to wait for them to be released.',\n",

The rye aroma was very inviting, and even more intriguing coming from this red brew. The floral and citrus hops gave the nose a distinctive IPA bouquet. The taste was an incredible combination of base and adjunct malts up front with a robust hop finish. The malts approach with a rich sweetness and the distinct taste of rye. As the malt mellows the hops take over with floral notes on the tongue and a touch of spiciness toward the back of the throat. The aftertaste is hoppy but nice. This beer finishes clean and does not leave the mouth sticky making it very drinkable, but beware of the 6.6% ABV. This drinkable beer can add up fast! Red's Rye PA is a fantastic new take on the classic IPA; rye beers are so few as it is, so coupling the unique taste of rye with the punch of an IPA makes for a unique, enjoyable, beer experience.

Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, bourbon, dark fruits, cinnamon, and some honey. Taste of oak, bourbon, caramel, roasted malt, and molasses. Fairly dry finish, but there is some lingering flavors of bourbon, caramel, and dark fruit sweetness that lasts for a decent period after the finish. No real significant amount of bitterness was noted, but there was a small amount. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied. Very smooth drinking with minimal alcohol noticed, only a small warming after the finish. Overall quite a tasty scotch ale we have here. Good stuff.',\n",

I created an account here just to review this beast. This beer evolves as you drink it in my opinion, not just a little but a lot. Sometimes it is almost overbearing in its strange hoppiness and the residual flavors coming off the scotch barrel's are quite complex. It seems to mellow out and allow its real flavor out the longer it sits in the glass. I always savor the last drink, as it reminds me of a quad or dark Belgian. Flavors for me range from vanilla, oaky, slight peetiness, delicious brownies and pure heavenly sugar. This beer is a beast and should be locked in a cage.\\t\\tM: The mouthfeel can be slightly drying. There are just so many flavors that it's hard to put my finger on them on all there effects. Sometimes this beer refreshes me, and sometimes it feels like it could kill me at any second. Be sweet to this beer or beware.\\t\\tD: I could drink this everyday but i want to watch my kids grow up. I really like this beer and would recommend it to anyone. In fact I do. A good kick back beer, really not a slammer but most the beers on this site are not chuggers. BEST SCOTCH STYLE ALE I'VE HAD !! Thanks Founders !!!\\tFirst review so maybe I have nothing to bring to the table. I just wanted documentation that I LOVE this beer.\",\n",

The color of the head is chocolate milk with extra syrup. Some pretty decent lacing. \\t\\tWhen I cracked this open, I held it six inches or so from my nose and I could start to pick up the aroma and I knew it was going to be good. Smells like there is a good combination of malts, but the strongest is certainly chocolate, a semi-sweet dark chocolate. There are also strong notes of a natural roasted barley. Hint of smokiness and a touch of alcohol that warms your nose.\\t\\tThe taste is truly excellent. The large amounts of malts are even more detected in the flavor profile. It tastes like a blend of bittersweet, semi-sweet, dark, and milk chocolate all blended together if that makes sense. Big flavor, slight smokiness again, but not as much as the smell. A natural sweet roasty flavor. This is truly a tasty beer, like chocolate milk for adults.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. It's certainly full bodied, and super smooth. Actually, smooth is an understatement, this sets a new standard for me, silky smooth sweetness. Excellent carbonation level and really not a bite from the alcohol which stands at 10.5%; it's barely detectable. Very easy drinking beer, anybody could polish this one off with ease. \\t\\tFounders does it again, I have 2 left that I'd like to put a little age on to see how they do. Its the end of May right now, I'd love to see how an aged one taste in the winter, who know's maybe I'll edit this and give it another 5 or two.\",\n",

I don't detect a strong hop taste in there, only a slight floral taste, but it's faint. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than expected, but it feels nice. No apparent carbonation (edit: need to check this out more, may have been the bar).

Smells like a hoppy, boozey barleywine, sweet and hoppy, and a little burnt malt or caramel. Something else dark and a little musty almost like tobacco on the nose.\\t\\tBig sweet malt explosion, full of caramel and a stronger sense of that tobacco-like taste I got from the nose. Almost like coffee, except it's a harsher sensation. Tastes burnt without that flavor dominating, it adds sort of an oaked sensation to it. Also reinforced by a whiskey-like bite to it at the end, as well as a whiskey-smokeyness after in the throat. Hops bitter towards the end of the palate, there for bittering effect to balance out the sweetness, and don't really add the taste of pine or another particular hop taste. Mouthful is thick and syrupy, it coats the palate and doesn't want to let go. Big bodied beer. A nice sipper, but the heavy presence of hard liquors/alcohol, combined with the harshness of the other flavors prevent this from being more than that. I like the change of pace, but I don't know if I want to pursue this beer again, at least fresh.\",\n",

Very drinkable. Smooth and enjoyable with an abv that isn't pronounced at all. I almost want to say this is a perfect breakfast beer, if there is such a thing. It's like grease for that stubborn engine in the morning.\",\n",

This retains with a thick  finger, leaving back a heavy cascade of lacing that hangs in a sticky latticework down the sides of the glass. The aroma is leafy and dank, with a pronounced spiciness to it and some faint metallic tones that eventually dissipate. Light supportive grains sit along the back but its mostly that green bitterness and spice that push through the most. \\t\\tHops coat the mouth in the taste, with a pithy bitterness and a deep spiciness that sticks to the tongue. There is a good bit of earthy and herbal character going on with this as well but that bitterness definitely has a raw and unrefined feel to it at times. The malts are thankfully silky smooth feeling along the back with notes of sweet caramel and toast but the rawness of those hops gets to be distracting, as this finishes dry, piney, and spicy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with more of a mellow creaminess to the carbonation that helps keep this pretty easy feeling overall despite the strength of the hops. \\t\\tI dont really know what I expected from this, as Stoudts isnt known for doing West Coast flavors in their hoppier beers (which is the type of American Ambers that I like). I guess maybe a hop profile that wasnt quite as green and raw feeling as what I got here. The malt profile and feel on this were fine but the bitterness here just took me out of this.

Nothing amazing, but highly competent.\\t\\tMouthfeel - 3.5\\tModerate to heavy weight in the mouth, carbonation is low to moderate. \\t\\tDrinkability - 4.5\\tI got through this bottle rather quickly. This is a very sessionable beer, especially considering the lowish 4.4% ABV. \\t\\tOVERALL - 3.7\\tThis is a damn sight better than most of the mainstream lagers and pilseners out there. Even in its slightly skunked state, this was more enjoyable than many mainstream lagers are on-tap. As an import, the price is high and the value average at best (similar quality pilseners are available for less). Possibly the best of the mainstream pilseners and lagers.\\t\\tRe-review:\\t\\tAppearance - 4.5\\tDeep gold to amber, creamy white head.\\t\\tSmell 3.5\\tLots of biscuity malt, slightly fruity.\\t\\tTaste - 3.5\\tBiiscuity malt, slightly buttery, assertive and spicy hops bitterness. Very dry in the finish.\\t\\tMouthfeel - 4.5\\tFine carbonation, very smooth in the mouth.\\t\\tDrinkability - 4.5\\tOnly 4.4% abv, one of the great session beers.\\t\\tOVERALL - 3.9\\tPilsner Urquell is a beer that greatly varies in quality. When at its best it is quite possibly the best pilsner in the world. Bitterness is perhaps not quite as pronounced as it used to be (reportedly 40 IBUs), but that could be due to the malty richness. A true classic.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12 oz bottle thanks to the amazing generosity of rhinos00. Served up in a DFH shaped pint glass.\\t\\tA: Pours a nice bright yellow to almost brown, a light honey brown if you will. Held to the light you get a lot more golden yellow coming out. The pour produces over finger of bright white head that seems to be pretty tight. The foam holds up really well and the lace is nice and sticky. Getting lots of sticky lines that barely slide down the glass. The brew is pretty clear and the carbonation is lazy. \\t\\tA: Lots of hops coming out here with a really fragrant presence. There are some nice grapefruit smelly hops going on here. Nice and tart smell. Then you get some nice resiny hops presence. Getting a really fragant floral presence as well. Touch of bready malt coming out on the back end, but the hops are the show here.\\t\\tT: Yet again, mostly all hops going on here but thats what we want right? Lots of grapefruit coming out here with some more tropical fruit, maybe a touch of pineapple. Then you get the nice earthiness that pine resin can easily provide. Bready malt tries to come in a bit, but to no avail. Getting some more citrus as well with a touch of lemon and orange. Sure its not that dynamic I suppose, but the flavors all mold together nicely and create a nice flavor profile.\\t\\tM: Getting a nice medium bodied fell with a nice slickness. Slightly oily from all the hops in here and it really clings to the teeth causing that hop ache a bit. The brew has a nice dryness to it that I am coming to expect from DIPAs. Alcohol is actually pretty nicely hidden and I was shoked this weighed in at 9.4%. Aftertaste is all grapefruit and pine.\\t \\tD: Its not bad at all. The drinkability is pretty good for a DIPA. Goes down pretty easy and doesn't sit too heavy. The teeth hop ache is a bit much at times, but it is manageable. This does remind more of a West Coast DIPA from a none west coast brewery. It works and gets the job done. Glad I had the chance.\",\n",

Appearance was average at best because of this. Good pumpkin ales need suds and lacing. It's supposed to be a sub-style of a Belgian.\\t\\tSmell: Some fairly rich, malty pumpkin underscored by some clove, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, and perhaps a bit of cinnamon. Sweet malt stuck right in the middle. Very good nose, I thought. It burns just the slightest bit from all the spiciness.\\t\\tTaste: I wish that the taste could have delivered like the nose. Usually, this is an indicator of the quality of ingredients used. It was very close to the nose, but it all seemed much thinner than what the nose lead you on to believe. I caught little hops though perhaps a bit of dryness poorly executed.\\t\\tMouth: Much thinner than I expected. Pumpkin ales should be full, rich, and complex, and I get the complex but neither the rich or the medium to full body. \\t\\tOverall: O'Fallon's pumpkin ale is lightyears away from Schlafly's. I live in Saint Louis, and so I will always get Schlafly's Pumpkin before I get this one. Fairly drinkable and a noble effort but it just writes a check in the nose that the taste can't cash.\",\n",

Smell is nice, grassy, above average but not exceptional. Taste is very satisfying - bitter, a little herbal, even a little bready, but clearly a fine beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and very nice, and drinkability is exceptional, apart from the slight skunkiness lingering in my mouth (although this is clearly due to the imported sample, and would not exist on tap).\\t\\tOverall, this is not a pilsener to be overlooked. Not the holy grail, but way better than its demure label might suggest.',\n",

Head quickly dissipates to a thin film with some large bubbles and very little streaky lacing. \\tS: Very piney hop smell with a slight smell of alcohol that becomes much stronger as the beer warms up. Also some malt hiding behind the hops, more of a boozy barleywine smell than expected for an IIPA.\\tT: Very little carbonation, thicker medium body and smooth, almost syrup like. Very strong malt body throughout resulting in a sweeter flavor than expected with a very dry, complex bitter hop finish. Mostly a piney taste, not much citrus. More of a barley wine than a IIPA. As expected for 13%, alcohol is very present and lingers in the finish. I'm not particularly crazy about this beer and will probably avoid this in the future.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12 oz. bottle with a purple colored label that has a head shot of one of the meanest looking rams I've ever laid my eyes on. Granted I haven't seen that many rams before, but the one on the label is out for blood, beer lovers blood that is. You can see it in his brown oval eyes. It almost looks like this ram's head is going to jump off the label and headbutt you so hard that you're not going to have a head anymore. The bottle I have has a much bigger picture of the ram then the one pictured on BA and that's why it looks like it's going to leap off the label and into your glass. Behind the rams head is some barley and slightly below his mouth are some clovers and hop buds. Below the ram is just the name of the beer, contents, and where it's brewed. The far left of the label is where the Government warning is kept and on the far right side is where they keep the refund prices and Stoudt's web address. Just when I thought there wasn't a date, there it was on the back on the neck near the cap. It's a best before date and mine is best before July 21st, 2007. Served in a Pilsener glass.\\t\\tIt poured a bright golden honey color that had a massive and I mean massive head of white pillowy foam. All I did was pour only an ounce or two of this beer and up comes this massive head of white foam from out of nowhere and almost overflowed this tall glass. The retention was too good because I had to wait 4 minutes before I could actually get to the beer itself. In it's aftermath, it left plenty of white sticky lace and white foamy rings around the glass. It had a light aroma of juicy fruits at first and then that drifted away into toasted grains, a touch of caramel, a dash of pepper, and into some crisp floral hops. The smell ended with the floral hops, but the taste began with those floral hops. After that there were some toasted malts, a small touch of juicy fruits, caramel, some spices, a slight drop of alcohol, and then it finished with those floral hops that were in the beginning of the taste. There was also some yeast in there, but of course that was only toward the bottom of the bottle. The mouthfeel was very light with moderate carbonation and with a very mild aftertaste of those floral hops that keep showing up again and again. The beer overall was a very nice light beer that's easily drinkable. I know it says it has 7% ABV, but I don't believe it. Would I drink another one? I wouldn't mind another one. I think this beer would make a good choice on a nice warm spring day.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"The first time I ever tasted Okocim Porter was at my first beer festival ever, back when I knew jack shit about beer (other than that I liked to drink it). I tried many different brews that day, and only one struck me as simply outstanding. Even though there were hundreds of beers to try, I kept draggin' my girlfriend back over to the Okocim table for more sips! This review will be the fourth time I've had this wonderful beer since then.\\t\\tPoured from an attractively dark and forboding bottle into a 22oz Okocim imperial pint glass. I get a kick out of Okocim's crest...it depics a long-horned ram about to slurp a giant foaming beer! How cool is that? \\t\\tThis one develops a two finger head that looks like a chocolate milk shake and leaves thick sticky lace on the glass and falls back into the brew as a solid sheet of miniscule bubbles. Oh shit, that is a nice head. I want to eat it with a spoon!\\t\\tThe nose is all malt, chocolate, and cream. I can smell both milk chocolate and dark chocolate and the same time! Malted milk balls and raisinets. Also... I can smell some freshly ground coffee. There is also a very nice earthy and woody foundation underneath all of that chocolate and coffee. \\t\\tThis is one tasty brew!! First, a tingly carbonation delivers loads of malt-chocolate goodness. Mid-sip, the carbonation rounds out into a thick creamy smoothness as a rich, smokey, earthy tone predominates. Then, and alcohol heat warms the throat and a bit of hop bitterness comes out to play. I love the way that the rich chocolate and vanilla cream flavors play over a very solid and robust foundation of salty, smokey, and earthy bitterness!! The finish is very slightly dry and bitter, and minutes later I can still taste chocolate, raisins, and coffee in my mouth! This is friggin' amazing. \\t\\tAs the beer warms, I can taste chocolate covered raisins, stronger coffee, and a very very slight hint of campfire smoke. There is also a bit of salt on the tongue that adds something very interesting to the complexity of this beer. Also, with time, the alcohol punch begins to really kick things up a notch! Even though this is definitley a chest thumping man's beer, the alcohol heat only adds (never detracts..as it often can in beers with this ABV) to the experience. I can just picture tough Polish sailor-type dudes quaffing this stuff.\\t\\tI must say that it is my favorite beer so far. It just gets better every time! This lovable beer is rich and complex, but at the same time highly drinkable. There are no qualities about this porter that I dislike. IMO it's just about as perfect as a beer can be!\\t\\tAs the Polish say.... NA ZDROWIE! (pronounced na-strovia, it means...here's to your health!)\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Picked this up in 22 oz bomber form at Rozis in Lakewood Ohio. I was suprised at the expense, $12.00 for a bomber is pretty much going to be a one time deal. Overall I enjoyed this but at that price there are several I prefer more at a much cheaper price. So Hoppin Frog if your reading then you need to get that price down. Especially since its local to me. Okay, Im done with that let's move on. Poured a nice copped color into a 12 oz snifter with about a finger of head. Nice hop aroma with strong alcohol smell. Taste was really great with Pine hops and nice balance. Good finish but slightly strong alcohol flavor. Would have thought this was higher than. 8.2 ABV. Mouthfeel was really good. Smooth drinker, just thick enough and perfectly corbonated. Drinkability is good for an individual but for the price good luck affording another. Summary: Lower the price and you'll have a great DIPA on your hands. Guess I'll just stick with Lake Erie Monster and Mad Hatter Imperial DIPA.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Interestingly enough before I ever tried this beer I tasted some ice cream a friend of mine had used Founders Breakfast Stout in that he was touting as \"stout ice cream\". After trying it I told him it didn\\'t taste anything like a stout, it only tasted like coffee ice cream. The other flavors had faded when mixed with so much else, but the coffee flavor stayed strong. After tasting and reviewing this beer I can see why!\\t\\tAppearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. This beer pours a dark, dark black that even when backlit with a lamp allows no light to pass though. There are absolutely no highlights in the glass, and this beer is blacker than any other I\\'ve had. It requires quite a vigorous pour to achieve a head from this beer, but when one does form it\\'s a beautiful dark brown color (almost like cinnamon), with a soft, pillowy texture. The appearance of this beer definitely signifies to any stout lover that \"something delicious is in store for you\".\\t\\tSmell: The nose of this beer hits like a truck, smelling of dark chocolate and, of course, coffee. Perhaps \"smell\" isn\\'t a strong enough word for the coffee aroma, because there\\'s enough coffee smell in this nose to make even the strongest cups of coffee feel a little self-conscious. Needless to say this is a coffee lovers beer, and I love coffee. I\\'m definitely looking forward to this one.\\t\\tTaste: This beer starts off very sweet and tasting of chocolate, moves to a strong espresso taste, and finishes with a moderate amount of hop bitterness. Founders claims this beer is only 25 IBU\\'s, but I would have guessed it at much higher. This beer tastes like the lovechild of a strong espresso and a sweet, smooth mocha; and Founders has done an incredible job of drawing every ounce of coffee flavor from those Sumatra and Kona beans. \\t\\tMouthfeel: The mouthfeel is big and full-bodied and feels heavenly smooth on the tongue. It\\'s a sign of a great beer when it manages to have such a full body and so many rich flavors and yet remain so incredibly creamy, and Founders Breakfast Stout is definitely in that category. \\t\\tDrinkability: There is absolutely no taste of the 8.3% alcohol the bottle claims this beer has, and I could definitely see myself getting into trouble with this one. The flavors, the body, the nose, and the smoothness of this beer combine to make for one incredibly drinkable stout.\\t\\tNotes: At the time of my review this beer is sitting at number sixteen on the Best of BA list (it\\'s been moving back and forth between fifteen and sixteen for a few weeks now) and it definitely deserves to be up there. My only complaint is that this is a seasonal release, but God knows I\\'ll be buying even more of it next year than I did this year. A phenomenal beer and a must try for any stout lover and especially any coffee lover!',\n",

Small white head that was never of any size. Mostly fine bubbles creating a white cap, with a scattering of little pimple bubbles. Heavy and dense lacing.\\tNice heavier quality to the feel prepares me for hop flavors and bitterness. A seemingly never ending finish of tartness with some enjoyable astringency sucking in my cheeks. Just a touch of malt flavors of sweet fruit up front, but it is very short-lived. Malt also shows with the nice pale malt flavor. The citrus, mild resin/pine, and fresh grass hop flavors present and then blend with the building bitterness and eventually giving in to the rising intensity of the tartness.\\tThis is heavy enough to slow down the drinking some, but light enough to take a nice drink. Ultimately the bitterness slows me down as much to enjoy the flavors as to allow the experience to pass through.\\tAn exceptional DIPA is made by the uniqueness of the experience. This doesn't hold that. This is a very nicely balanced and flavored drink with no apparent problems or issues. I like it.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I first tried this Triple IPA at the EBF in 05. Loved the sample I had, but havent been able to get my hands on this since then. Medium dark ruby rushes into the Duvel tulip. Ample, sticky, creamy mocha head. Looks inviting. Sweet, sugary malt on the nose with rum-soaked fruits, alcohol, and venomous hops. Slightly medicinal, but not too overly. Toasted, sharp bitterness up front. Moves quickly to sugary sweet and fruit concentrate. Not cloying, however, due to surges of massive hop oil bitterness. Candied bananas and liqueurs linger in an otherwise very bitter finish. Full, syrupy body, that somewhat dries out a bit in the finish. Warming and pretty drinkable for the power and hop fury. Another great Founders beer!',\n",

I will confirm with O'Fallon, but I think I just got a bad bottle. Which kinda blows as all the other bottles are sold. \\t\\tSmell - Jim Beam, smoke, chocolate malt, and more Jim Beam. \\t\\tTaste - Jim Beam, but watered down. Smoke was there, very subtle, mainly got chocolate malts which add to the flavor of the Jim Beam. Overall a very tasty beer, but maybe a little watery, again, I think this has to do with the carbonation issue I mentioned above.\\t\\tMouthfeel - Smooth, oh so smooth. But watery. More watery than what smoked porter should taste like. I was surprised as it was lighter, much lighter than what I am used to. \\t\\tDrinkability - I shared this bottle with two friends, got about the same repsonses from each. I have another bottle that I will be cracking open someday soon. But I will be buying this when it hits the shelves AGAIN in a couple months.\\t\\tOverall, this was worth the wait. I love the taste of the smoke and the mix of the JIm Beam. The oak flavors added, which are hard to distinguish as this IS a smoked porter are lovely subtle and sometimes very noticable. \\t\\tI will say that taking the wax OFF the bottle was hard as the wax actaully worked its way under the lip of the cap. I think that this may be the reason mine was under carbonated. Deffiently an empty I am keeping for my bar collection.\",\n",

The first notable thing is the low carbonation, evidenced by almost no pffft sound when I opened the bottle. Also there was no head, just a thin ring of tan bubbles where the beer meets the glass.\\t\\tBut the smell and taste are the most important dimensions, and both were really good. It smelled STRONG, like whiskey and roasted malt. The flavor was heavily malted and had decent currents of chocolate and whiskey. No coffee that I could smell or taste. Or maybe on reflection just a hint of coffee.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel was thick and chewy, really nice. Overall I'm glad I tried it, but it's too big to drink too often so it's no problem that it's brewed like once a year.\",\n",

The smell is sweet and with a swivel of the glass, dark smells of blood and formaldehyde(not really). It is quite amazing really, rich bourbony chocolate.\\t\\tT: The underlying flavor is sweet honey joined by vanilla oak mellowness with an overtone of bourbon. A gentle hop bitterness joins the fun followed by anise. \\t\\tM: This is heavy in the mouth but quite creamy and smooth. As expected, the high ABV gives some heat to the tongue causing some drying. \\t\\tD: The 8oz pour offered at the brewery will provide you with at least 30 minutes of near flavor overload.

Then again, my fridge stays a bit colder than I'd like it to for the beer's sake due to the missus. The first thing I got in the nose was paste. Reminded me of kindergarten. Then I started thinking in terms of smoke and I realized it was just smokiness, like from a campfire. Some alcohol sting, and sweet, tart malt are in there too. No yeast or hops to speak of in the nose (or taste, for that matter). Sweet amber malt hits the tongue first, then super smoky flavors take over. I get some sweet nutiness in the finish but bitter smoke remains on the palate. A bit thick mouthfeel. Smooth, wet finish.\\t\\tSorry, but I just couldn't get paste out of my mind and that definitely affected my feelings of this beer. Although I had a bad reaction to the smell, the taste wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was interesting to say the least. I'm surprised this came from Germany. If I had to guess without knowing who made it, I'd have said Rogue because of the super strong smokiness. I appreciate what they are trying to do. I just wish I had it with some barbeque, as I think it would make a great pairing. Gotta give it to them for hiding the 8% so well, too. I wouldn't necessarily buy it again, but it was an interesting experience.\",\n",

Very pungent and fruity. This slightly old bottle has no presense of hops.\\t\\tT- A good fruit beer that focuses on raspberry flavor with malts backing that. The fruit comes through pretty harsh with some bitterness at the end, ever so slight. Any tartness is low while the rasp. taste stays for a bit.\\t\\tM- Sweet and a bit tart with a medium feel. This goes down real easy though and is even smoother off a tap. A bit of carbonation is on the mouth as well. A raspberry juice taste stays for a bit afterwards.\\t\\tD- Sad to see it go but loved it while it was here. A decent abv and a good taste, I could drink a 4-pack no problem.

A bit prickly on the tongue, with a good malt/hop balance that does a pretty good job of quenching the thirst. Hints of alcohols and yeast are also present in the background. The finish is pretty clean, with a nice roundness, but the aftertaste is somehow reminiscent of an ice cream cone - no ice cream, just the cone. And not a sugar cone, either - one of those light yellow Eat-Em-All ones.  Despite all that, it somehow manages to be a rather quaffable beer, even if it isn't up to the standards of its big brother (Old Slugger).\",\n",

It's almost solid when held to light, with only very faint ruby highlights shining through. The first pour yielded barely two fingers of foam, while the second pour manages to churn up a full three fingers worth. Retention is alright, and there's a fair amount of lacing, but the color of the head is what really grabs attention. It's the offspring of lavender and a dark pink/light red shade, and it's much more vivid than the head from any other fruit beer I've ever seen. The nose is quite potent, and it screams raspberries, with just a little bit of sugary sweetness present as well. The flavor is just as one note as the aroma, and it really gets old as I make my way through the bottle. The flavor is exclusively of sugared up raspberries, and people referring to to the beer as alcoholic raspberry soda aren't off base at all. The body is a little flabby, especially for a Belgian brew, but the sparkling carbonation is perfectly suited to the beer. This is one that would be much better served by a smaller serving size, as the all out raspberry assault quickly gets old.\",\n",

Espresso head barely gets a chance to form, and dissipates leaving a full opaque black circle outlined by tan head. Ominous, and looks like a lunar eclipse from above.\\t\\tS: First scents are sweet roasted coffee and sweet chocolate reminiscent of cake frosting.

Smooth, very palatable vanilla heat comes through from the barrel. Maple and caramel round it out.\\t\\tM: This is no doubt a heavy beer, but feels smooth and drinkable on my palate. Perfect bite of carbonation up front moves across creating a creamy, silky mouthfeel. Honestly delectable.\\t\\tO: Let this beer warm up! I served it a bit cold, but its transformation to cellar/room temperature was a pleasure. It's true that they say this beer is dangerously drinkable. It lives up to it's hype. It's complex without being overbearing. Its flavor is smooth and well-rounded but diverse and really takes you on an adventure. 11.2% ABV? Could have fooled me. Now, how to get more...\",\n",

I found out it was brewed once per year rather than semi-ann or quarterly, and that the release was going to be over my spring break\\'s ending weekend. Calling! I tried their amazing Breakfast Stout the previous summer and it was nothing short of amazing.. it is the one that I sipped once, and then again, while thinking \"I think I want to learn to like stouts!\" I added the color stout to my palate.\\t\\tKBS:\\tIt is not as think as one might expect, especially compared to the Old Curmudgeon I had at school the following night(sticky! but in foam) It did pour an almost black brown into my glass. The aroma of bourbon was prominent, also containing chocolate and coffee notes.\\t\\tThe taste was sort of 3 parts. It seemed to start with chocolate and a little coffee, then more chocolate and other ingredients(incl. oatmeal). Then you get hit with chocolate, oatmeal, and bourbon. Finally, the finish gives you some chocolate but the bourbon is sort of in your nose, too, providing somewhat stronger noted than before.\\t\\tThis beer was incredible. Just as you are ready to say that it is tied with regular Breakfast Stout, just different, you realise how delicious the bourbon flavor really is, and how much it adds by being obviously present in the aroma and taste, but without the alcohol taste to spoil it. And KBS is ridiculously drinkable. Definitely could creep up on you. Enjoy!',\n",

The hop smell is overpowered by citrus and sweetness. It tastes sweet and hoppy and the alcohol is noticeable, but I expect hoppiness and alcohol in a DIPA. Not as hoppy as some other DIPA's I've had though. The flavors are well balanced and leaves a little stickiness on the tongue. It drinks well but should be enjoyed slowly. Two of these will make you toasty. Definitely a double IPA that I will be buying more of, though for whatever reason it seems to be difficult to find in my local beer stores, unlike other Stoudts offerings.\",\n",

The bubbles are popping rapidly, but they're so fine and so tightly packed that little deflation has occured in the first several minutes. Respectable.\\t\\tThe nose is typical Euro strong lager, although it's weaker than most. That means that any offensiveness that might have been present is kept to a minimum and that no alcohol is noted. Both are good traits in a lack of negatives kind of way. I need something of a positive nature if I'm going to grant an average score.\\t\\tI feel the same way about the flavor, more or less. One thing Baro has going for it over the nose is that I can actually taste something. Unfortunately that 'something' is nothing to shout about. Sweet corny grain and a modicum of noble hops is about it. The low ABV (relative to the style average) helps to keep alcohol flavor and burn to a bare minimum.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is on the full side of medium and possesses a finishing slickness that could stand a few more bubbles to liven things up. I expected more carbonation than I'm getting because crown cracking led to a louder than usual 'pffft'.\\t\\tThis is my first beer from Rinkuskiu Alaus Darykla. Needless to say, I'm less than impressed. Since I have several of their higher ABV offerings in my cellar, I was hoping for something from Baro Traditicinis that would make me remember it past the time when I wash out my glass.

       "  'review/text': 'Now this one was an anomaly to me. I had heard about it several times before, and received it as an extra from a BIF that I cannot remember, but that I do know contained tons of Founders at the time. This is a 2007 Vintage twelve-ounce bottle, that I do know and I have had it in the closet for at least a few months, so it has had a bit of time to relax. I am not sure what kind of concoction I am getting myself into over here; however, it looks intriguing to say the least. Retrieved the bottle from the fridge and let it warm up a few minutes, before serving it into a Sam Adams fluted pint glass.\\t\\tA - Poured this one very hard into the glass, trying to elicit as much out of it as I possibly could. What I got was about a finger worth of tan head across the top, and this quickly faded before my eyes, and left behind only a thin film of lace and bubbles across the top to carry on the foam. This then faded rather quickly, and then really all that was left after that was a thin line of bubbles across the top. There was a very nice color to this, a deep hickory brown with a very cloudy and hazy consistency to it. Not bad overall, I could see some carbonation, barely making it out through the haze. Very nice looking indeed.\\t\\tS - The aroma was full of bourbon and alcohol, absolutely ripe with it from the first smell I could take in. I t was really coming across quite heavy. Once I let it warm up a bit it started to take on much more character. A very nice deep malty backbone was starting to push through. Lots of sweet notes taking over on this one, with hints of caramel, vanilla and nice earthy grains starting to come to the front. Definitely, some wood somewhere in its history as the aroma of oak was huge on this one. I would really pick up the bourbon barrel clearly, and knew this was going to be a big one.\\t\\tT - The flavor was a touch hot to be honest. Loaded down with alcohol a bit more then I thought it would be, and it took a good few minutes to really mellow out before I could appreciate it for what it was. Once the alcohol mellowed, some lovely sweet notes started to mingle in. Lots of caramel and vanilla starting to take shape here, really lightning it up and make it that much sweeter. Next up in the lineup was a full on assault of the oak and wood flavors that were coming through earlier. Strong hints of oak and bourbon dominating it here, really giving it a deep flavor and pronounced presence. Definitely some more alcohol in the finish now, no doubt about that, as I was left with a long drawn out flavor of rich bourbon and caramel, with the ever so slightly dry hop finish. Really quite complex and very nice indeed.\\t\\tM - The feel on this one was a bit tricky to be honest. It was quite nicely nestled in the medium-bodied ale category with a nice rich profile and really complex finish. Good carbonation stayed with it till the end never letting it get dull or boring in any way. Definitely not thing, but it was a little slick to be honest. Still very nice, and smooth.\\t\\tD - I could definitely have gone for another one of these when all was said and done. It was definitely a sipper due to the strong nature of it, however it was really quite complex, and the warmer it got the better it was received. Not something you would drink all night, but one or two would be no issue.\\t\\tOverall, this was a really nice and quite complex wee heavy. I have had ones strong then this, but this was almost borderline on a old ale. It was just full of alcohol and really sweet tones. Very nicely crafted and definitely a quality brew. I look forward t having another one day.',\n",

Also a lot of vanilla, a bit of fruit, banana and pear, some caramel, spice, some alcohol as well on the nose, very good strength. \\t\\tFlavor is a delicious balance of bourbon whiskey, maple syrup, vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, green raisins, spice. Alcohol burn has diminished drastically but this monster of a beer does still leave me with some warmth in my chest. \\t\\tMouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, finishes a bit sticky, low carbonation. \\t\\tThis was a bit too boozy for me when fresh but really drinking very, very nice right now. Can't wait to see what additional aging will do! \\t\\t---\\t\\tOriginal Review, March 7, 2010:\\t\\t12oz bottled Feb 3, 2010. Served in a Duvel glass. Pours amber/copper with a very small off-white head that quickly reduces to a light ring and doesn't leave much lacing at all. \\t\\tAroma is a little quiet but improves with warming. Features caramel malts, some bourbon and oak, good dose of vanilla, a bit of spice and hops, a touch of the maple syrup. \\t\\tFlavor improves on the aroma, more sweet caramel malts, maple syrup is more prominent, wood, some floral hops, vanilla, bourbon is very strong along with the alcohol, a good dose of spice on the finish. Almost a beer version of whiskey, very boozy. Interesting at the very least. \\t\\tMouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit sticky, low carbonation. \\t\\tGlad to get my hands on this, good right now but not blown away, especially for the price.

Well, I can't lie early on in my drinking days I used to imbibe on the St. Ides Special Brews (original alcohol pops) leave me the hell alone Snoop used to sing in their commercials what do you expect from a thug rap loving eighth grader. Anyways on to the high gravity version of this malt liquor it appears a bright golden yellow hue with a vibrant white head leaves fine even lacing as the thick head dwindles pretty quickly. Aromatics...well I can't say this is any type of a beer delicacy very heavy on corn and rice along with alcohol in the aroma not good at all sweet smelling overall I guess. Taste...wow possibly the worst beer or malt liquor I've ever tasted I compare this one to paint thinner toned flavors with very sweet and alcoholic tones hitting you at once seems chemical as a whole no hop profile to be had just pure shit, awwgh cloyingly sweet with a slight metallic layer on the tongue and alcohol remains horrible. Mouthfeel fizzy textured heavy carbonation definitely could cause a gag reflex to occur on the typical drinker. Drinkability don't even rate this brew as an option to grab onto I was in a ghetto liquor malt and grabbed one for fun 99cents well the experiment is over this shit is horrible.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Ba Review #86\\tServed On: 11/12/2011 \\tGlassware: Pint Glass\\tLabeled ABV: -\\tDate/ Code: -\\t\\tThis was from a 6 pack I picked up at the brewery a couple days ago. \\t\\tLook: Poured a very cloudy orangish yellow color. Two finger white frothy head with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation was rather low for a bottle conditioned beer. \\t\\tSmell: Sweet floral pine and grapefruit with rich malty notes. Aroma was basically a mix between the East and West coast styles.\\t\\tTaste: Pine was first and then completely opened up into a tropical fruit with mango and spicy hops. The finish was somewhat clean with pine and grapefruit notes and a slight alcohol warmth. Body is full and syrupy with a soft mouth feel. I just kept wanting more after each sip. \\t\\tThis is an excellent double IPA. The drinkablity and complexity is just off the charts. This brew was actually one that prompted my transition into the craft beer world. It will always hold a special place in my heart. Although it is rather pricy at $12.50 per 6-pack (and thats even direct from the brewery).',\n",

Good staying power there. Looks pretty good. \\t\\tS: I was expecting worse. New Zealand's a long way away, and I assumed this would be old and wasted by the time it arrived. Not quite so. Yes, there's some fade, but I still get a nice, bright, perhaps Cascade-like nose and a balanced malt body--not too sweet, like some faded IPAs or DIPAs can get. Still, the straw-like malt predominates. \\t\\tS: Things come out somewhat better in the taste. There are still some powdery, citrusy notes in the middle, with a bitter but not overwhelming finish. I get a noticeable diacetyl flavor, but I think it works alright, right at the threshold. Overall, it's actually pretty good, despite an assumed age. \\t\\tM: Good carbonation and moderate body deliver 7% ABV pretty nicely. Typical, in a good way. \\t\\tO: I was skeptical buying an expensive IPA from a faraway land, but this wasn't bad. No need to go switching from your favorite fresh place, but I'm glad to see NZ putting out pretty quality beer. If I could get this fresh on the regular, I'd be all over it, for sure.\",\n",

As a coffee lover, I definitely love the fact that the big coffee aroma and dark roasted malts from the underlying beer is still dominant, but the reason it's world class is the maple syrup sweetness.\\t\\tWell, if the aroma is stunning, then the taste is sublime.

       "  'review/text': 'I was expecting a light malty beer with a note or 2 of cherries. What I got was vice versa. I searched for malt flavors and really could not find any. If I didn\\'t trust Founders, I\\'d have guessed this to be a cherry-dominated cider. Fortunately my wife and I shared one of these over dessert, so it worked well in that role.\\t\\tThis looks like cherry-flavored champagne, bright reddish-pink with heavy carbonation and an evanescent white head. Aroma is all cherries, with a little citrus in a supporting role. Flavor is true to the aroma, but quite impressive in that the strong cherry flavor doesn\\'t bear a hint of the harshness or \"jolly rancher\" character one would expect from the use of a flavor extract or artificial flavorant.\\t\\tit is quite light-bodied, and it could be sessioned if one really enjoys this sort of product. For someone not so much into this sort of brew, I\\'m not going back for more, but I can recognize and respect the quality of this offering.',\n",

Thanks to NeroFiddled for this one!\\t\\tA - The bubbly honeyed golden amber color is brilliantly clear accented by a small but sustained white head. A collar of lacing is left on the glass.\\t\\tS - The aroma starts with a light toasty malt nose with a subtle caramel hint to it and finishes off with a clean and crisp, possibly noble, hop aroma that's lightly floral. The nose is delicate but not necessarily weak.\\t\\tT - The flavor is an ever-changing amalgam in the mouth. Starting malty, it's got a light caramel-like sweetness to it that quickly changes to a hop crisp bitterness and back to a toasty and nutty, earthy malt with a hint of wood. Complex and tasty for an oktoberfest.\\t\\tM - The initial sweetness is washed clean by the lightly bitter hops. Medium-bodied and crisp, it finishes dry with a carbonation kick.\\t\\tD - I enjoyed my first Stoudt's experience. Tasty and easily drinkable in Liter mugs, it's one of my more favorite oktoberfests this season. It has a complex and delicate malt and hop balance that doesn't beat you over the head.

Sweet, slightly earthy, and big allspice notes. Pretty straightforward, but pleasant. \\t\\tTaste: Sweet and TONS of spice (allspice). Spice spice spice. Earthy, fruity characteristics as well. Light alcoholic notes, and a bit of brown sugar. A bit different, but nothing offensive really. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium-bodied, and slightly alcoholic\\t\\tOverall: The sweetness and allspice notes are nice, and there's a weird earthiness as well that is a bit unique and interesting.

Perfect choice after a hot July bike ride.\\tHeard about this earlier, and couldn\\'t resist curiosity when I came upon this questionable beverage today. \\t\\tPoured into a large tapered Spaten glass. Served cold. A fizzy swarm of bubbles rose to the surface, but couldn\\'t generate much of a head at all. After a minute, all that\\'s left is a wispy white skim. Some slow, ascending bubbles visible. Super clear pastel yellow. \\t\\tSmells a little like hard lemonade/Sprite with lemon zest. Not too excited about it, as it seems sort of artificial. \\t\\tTastes like a 50/50 blend of lemonade and pilsner. There\\'s the lingering taste of pilsner malt in the aftertaste, and sweet/tart lemon in the forefront. Flavor isn\\'t as artificial as the smell, and it has some astringency that suggests natural ingredients. It\\'s a simple mix, nothing overly sweet or lacking to me. It has the suggestion of \"beer\", mixed with lemonade like a traditional radler. The higher abv kick is hidden, which is the real attraction I guess. It\\'s easily quaffed, and is very quenching without being sugary. \\t\\tYes this is a novelty, but I can think of many worse ones that don\\'t have the utter sessionability that Turbo Shandy does. Far better than Steigl Radler and Summer Shandy. Good crossover potential for those who \"don\\'t like beer\".',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"So here we are, down to the last of the four varieties from the Kirkland sampler case. I drank my way (with just a very wee bit of help) through most of the case last weekend camping but held four back, one of each, for an official review. I've got to say though, that each and every one of them irritated me during the camping trip, but I had chalked that up to the Yeti's, Arctic Panzer Wolves, Surlys and Bells that were intermixed. But I digress.\\t\\tThe appearance is good. It looks like an IPA, it's a darker shade of orange with a finger of tawny head that hangs in there and leaves decent lacing.\\t\\tThe smell, what smell?? Faintly floral at best. What's the deal with these Kirkland beers and lack of odor? JHC\\t\\tThe taste is malt forward, think biscuits, then a washing of bitter, floral hops, with a bit of funkiness I can't place. The finish is bitter and dry but mildly unpleasant.\\t\\tOverall, hmm..cheap beer or good beer..your choice.\",\n",

Poured a very nice deep dark brown, nearly black and opaque with a smallish, maybe one inch white to off white head on top. This faded gradually leaving behind a nice amount of side glass lace. Smell was very sweet, nice hints of nuts and caramel, along with a roasted barley. The taste was very smooth, and rich and creamy. Very nice caramel flavor with a hint of coffee. Roasted nuts in the back with a very hoppy finish. This actually snuck up on me and I thought it was remnants of the IPA from dinner I thought I was tasting, but it actually had quite the dry hoppy finish.',\n",

There really isn\\'t much to say regarding the flavor profile. It\\'s an incredibly simple combination of pale malts and lemon, with the proportions right where they should be.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is light-medium and isn\\'t as fizzy as expected. The bubbles are actually well done. The sugars give it a stickiness that lightly coats the mouth and tongue after each sip. Like lemonade, just not to the same extent.\\t\\tTurbo Shandy is a pretty good summertime (non-beer) beverage, as long as you know what you\\'re getting into. Again, this is what all hard lemonades should taste like. If this offering is the replacement for Smashin\\' Berry Ale and Smashin\\' Berry Dark, then it\\'s a smashing success.',\n",

The aroma is of banana, some clove and pepper, a bit of a lemon twang. The taste is a tad tart with lemon and green followed by some banana; not strong banana flavor but enough to smooth out the flavor. Not much spice or clove in this hefe. A little too much like an American wheat to me. A moderate feel, with tingly carbonation, finishes sweet and tart. A very nice looking hefe which fails to deliver on the taste. Again, reminds me more of an American wheat.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I very nearly killed myself hunting down a four pack of KBS this year, only to trade each bottle away and, in turn, trade for a few more. Thank you for this one Handle. 2011 bottle into a tulip.\\t\\tIt just glugs out of the bottle, like thick motor oil. Pitch black. A very dark brown head with some large bubbles forms, but it's barely there before it fades, leaving a ring of lace around my glass. Minimal lacing, nothing too enticing. Tiny legs. Leaves an oily film around the glass.\\t\\tA very sweet-smelling beer. Wood and a lot of vanilla come through, and underneath there's just a little bit of alcohol. Really not too much coffee here, but there is a strong aroma of dark chocolate fudge. The bourbon is the centerpiece. \\t\\tTaste is smooth as silk. The bourbon presence is huge: to a greater degree than the aroma, there is just a ton of oak and vanilla. Leather and tobacco compliment these flavors nicely. Oddly enough, my initial thoughts are of smoking a cigar - not necessarily because of the taste itself, but because all of these huge flavors coat my whole mouth like thick smoke so all I can think about is KBS. The alcohol is kept in check, though this is warm going down. Really rich chocolate. Some bitter coffee grounds, but they seem to have toned down after a few months in the bottle. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel is awesome: thick, rich and syrupy. The carbonation errs on the lighter side, which works perfectly. All -bal aged stouts should drink like this.\\t\\tA standard bearer of the style, it's a shame this has become a hassle to procure in Boston. I was so happy to send my bottles off this spring, and only now can I see the folly of my ways.\",\n",

Yummy!!!\\t\\tMouthfeel is dry and crisp, with a light body.\\t\\tDrinkability is very good, this is the best dark saison I've ever had, the malts chosen provided an excellent addition to the well made base saison without overwhelming it.

My first time trying the beer but I've got another (gold cap-batch 2) aging in the cellar for later.\\t\\tAppearance- Pours opaque black as per the style with a minimal ring of tan head around the edges of the glass. Appears to be very mild carbonation and little to no lacing left as I drink.\\t\\tSmell- Very up front with the whiskey and oak. Lots of boozy whiskey and vanilla. A faint whiff of coffee roastiness and chocolate.\\t\\tTaste- Again, the whiskey dominates here. Huge amounts of whiskey and wood are the most prominent flavors and really take up most of the flavor profile. In the background are some of the notes of bitter chocolate and roast that came through in the nose, but they are very secondary to the whiskey and wood. Astringent alcohol on the finish, and I fell as though this would benefit and round out from some aging.\\t\\tMouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is pretty spot on for the style, a bit thin from the barrels but with appropriate levels of carbonation. However, in terms of drinkability for the style, I found this one to be much to far towards the side of bourbon and alcohol to get better than average marks on drinkability.\\t\\tOverall, this was a beer which I feel has a lot of potential and was decent but could be much better if aged. If the alcohol and whiskey profile had a chance to settle a bit it would probably have a much more rounded flavor profile in my opinion. Will have to revisit the second bottle in the future.\",\n",

It's a very cloudy amber/brown with no head to speak of, and the nose is more of an old ale or barleywine, it's boozy and malty, there's some rasin notes to it as well, pretty off-putting for an IIPA.\\t\\tWow, this is not good. It's very alcoholic, it's sweet and syrupy. No idea why this has such a high rating? It's got a very sharp bitter bite, but it's not floral, fruity or even vegetal it's just abrasive and uninspired. Carbonation is low and because it's so thick it's hard to drink. I wish I hadn't of bought this, it's taken Founders down a notch or two in my book.\\t\\tI can't read the bottled on date as it's a bit screwed up, it looks like 11/10, but that's clearly not the case as I bought it on the 6th of november in MA.\",\n",

Big, foamy 3-finger head that diminishes to about 1-finger relatively quickly, but than hangs on for the ride. Lots of bright bubbles.\\t\\tS - Sweet malts, little to no hops aroma. Caramel notes. Nothing stands out too much about this aroma, but given the style guidelines, I think the aroma is extremely representative.\\t\\tT - When I saw what this beer was classified here as a Wee Heavy at 7.0% abv, I was skeptical. Upon tasting the beer, though, this is an extremely accurate classification, given the 2 main scottish ale categories. Somehow, the alcohol character of this ale beats its way through the sweet malt to make its presence known. My initial taste was slightly metallic, but this flavor faded with subsequent sips. It seems the metallic taste lives mostly in the head, as when I topped up my glass, it returned with assertiveness. Were it not for this off-flavor, I'd rate this beer much higher.\\t\\tM - Slightly slick, but to a degree that is actually pleasant. Slightly excessive carbonation for my tastes, lending a prickly character that is not in keeping with my tastes for this beer. A more subdued carbonation level would allow the sweet maltiness to take hold a bit more. Still, pleasant overall in the mouth.\\t\\tD - One does not often endeavor to sit down and drink more than a few Wee Heavys. That being said, I would gladly accept a few of these on a cool night. Drinkable, but enough's enough.\\t\\tOverall - I quite liked this beer, Wee Heavy being among my favorite styles. I'd have liked to see a bit more complexity, perhaps some smokiness? A bit more chutzpah in a beer meant to be assertive might have overpowered the slight off-flavors present. Still, tasty and worth a visit or two.\",\n",

I love it when I can find a great example of a German pilsner here in the US made by a US micro. I also love it when an American micro can take a beer like a German pils and make it better. That is what I think Stoudt's has done here. The beer pours a very pale yellow with and ever so slight haze. It's so pale it is almost florescent. But don't let the color fool you. This is no light beer. It is medium to light bodied and full flavored. Aroma is spot on, bursting with grassy noble hops and yeasty bread. Bitterness is higher than the average pils,and that is a great thing. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. This and Prima Pils by Victory are great American pilsner beers.

Very wine-like, with sour, malt, alcohol, and light a earthy-tart character. Reminds me very much of the famous New Glarus Belgian Red wih raspberry instead of cherry.\\t\\tI'm not generally a big fruit beer fan, but this one is no ordinary fruit beer. Highly recommend.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Had this on tap at Founders the night before the KBS party.\\t\\tThis is one nice looking beer. Thick, dark amber almost brown color with a thin head.\\t\\tSmells like vanilla, bourbon, and molasses with a little bit of oak. I personally enjoyed smelling this one quite a bit. Fantastic.\\t\\tTastes very oaky. The bourbon and the vanilla just make this beer incredible. It is very intense and is a sipper. The bourbon shines through over all other tastes. It is a dessert beer but a true treat.\\t\\tMouthfeel is kind of awkward to review for this beer because I can compare it more to sipping on a fine whiskey than a beer because it is not very carbonated but very alcohol forward in intensity.\\t\\tThis may be tough to take more than one down but that one will last you a while. Every sip is to be savored and the alcohol will sink in. This is delicious, try it if possible.',\n",

Beautiful, crystal clear amber color.\\t\\tSmell: Some caramel malt lends a bit of sweetness to the nose. Biscuit malts as well. A piney hop aroma comes through that I didn\\'t get much of last year. Certainly smell more hoppy than it did last time, but again, it is fresher.\\t\\tTaste: Whole new beer compared to older bottles from last year. Sweet caramel malts, some biscuit and some bread there. Incredibly balanced with some oily, piney hops. Not over whelming hops, I\\'d say its a very even mix of malt and hop. Probably not to style, but very enjoyable.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Very crisp, incredibly smooth. Low to Medium carbonation, some slight hop bitterness lingers at the end and a bit of a hop oil slick on the tongue. Very slight though.\\t\\tDrinkability: Masks the 7% beautifully. Tastes great.\\t\\tI wanted to give this a 4.5 in taste, based on my own preferences, but docked it that .5 in an effort to score \"to style.\" Pretty hoppy compared to other dopplebocks I\\'ve had, not as much of a malt presence, but it should be made clear, I love this beer.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Presentation: Friday 9th April, 2004 was spent in Binche, Belgium, the home of Brasserie La Binchoise. Sadly our planned trip to both the Brewery and on-premises Tavern proved fruitless thanks to the fact that it was closed.\\t\\tA short walk into the center of Binche and we happened across Du Cte De Chez Boule, a small Brown Caf just off the main square. I tried three beers in here. La Binchoise Brune Tradition was the second and was from the Bottle.\\t\\tAppearance: Dark brown body, cloudy pour from the bottle, but the light tanned intensely smooth and creamy head formed in a quick rampant manner which took some time to settle down to a thick carpet covering. As with the earlier Blonde from the Tap, there is immense carbonation in this one.\\t\\tNose: This has a sweet and spicy nose. Dark sweet malts with a detectable orange odor, as with the Blonde, the Brune is also uses orange peel. Some herbal hints as well.\\t\\tTaste: Toasted sweet malts and some orange stained aniseed build up from the start. Fierce carbonation give this Brune an intense feel, this is definitely not a run-of-the-mil Brune for sure! Fruity and flavorful, sweet yet sharp, malty yet fruity with a herbal twist. Finishes with a fruity bitter finish that has a touch of liquorice.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Yet again the intense carbonation helps to add to this big-Brune, but it could become a factor in its long term Drinkability for me. Sharp orange peel on the cheeks and aniseed on the cheeks after the swallow.\\t\\tDrinkability: Much bigger that the earlier Blonde, which is why the Caf we tried this in, only had it from the Bottle, this is definitely not a session brew! That said it is a very wholesome Brune and an accomplished one at that. \\t\\tOverall: cost 2.30 for the 33cl short stubby Bottle. A very distinctive, large, bitter-sweet spicy Brune which has real Balls. Well worth a try!',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Acquired this 2009 bottle in a trade with nflmvp. Thanks Steve! ABV listed at 8.7%.\\t\\tPoured into a Rmy Martin snifter.\\t\\tAppearance: Tan, foamy crown quickly dissipates to a hair-thin halo. The body is a deep auburn color that turns crimson when held to light. Yellow-orange near the edges. Clarity is nice, but I spot quite a few floaties inside. When swirled, the beer leaves an oily residue coupled with spotty lacing on the walls of the glass - neither of which have a lot of staying power though. I'm excited. Time to dig in!\\t\\tSmell: Strong molasses/caramel, sweet bourbon, and loads of grain. Mmmmm... this is bourbon barrel-aging done right! Alcohol is present but totally tolerable. Vanilla and flowery esters complete the aroma.\\t\\tTaste: Clean grains, caramel, and bourbon. More earthy and alcoholic than the aroma let on, but still damn good. Subtle, flowery hops come through in the finish, mixing with dry bourbon. After reading a couple of the other reviews, I started picking up on raisins, too. Still, I'm not getting a whole lot of complexity from this one, but it is well-balanced and enjoyable.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Rich in flavor, bu the body is thin and oily with very light carbonation. Finishes dry and prickly, leaving bourbon-y undertones all over the palate. Still, this is working well for me right now - it's only 11:00AM. Still, a thicker body would be nice.\\t\\tDrinkability: I just bombed a final exam, and Backwoods Bastard is acting as the perfect comfort beer. A little more complexity would be nice, but then again my mind is totally shot right now. Not great, but certainly recommended.\",\n",

A nice little coffee w/cream head finishes off a darn good looking beer.\\tThe smells take me to a Costa Rican plantation that grows both chocolate and coffee, this beer smells awesome. Better then awesome, they should bottle this smell and make a perfume out of it. \\tThe chocolate and coffee thunder through in the taste as well, yeah the alcohol is there, but it doesn't offend you at all. As the beer warms, the two notes of chocolate and coffee still dominate but they do make room for hints of spice and oatmeal to meander across your taste buds. I think I would drink this stuff through a straw I enjoyed myself so much. \\tTypical stout in that it looks really thick but once you get it in your mouth it is pretty light. I wouldn't have more then 2 in an evening but that barely detracts from this beer. \\tI used to hate stouts, then I started to like them as an occasional treat, then I started to appreciate them as an after dinner delight . . .this beer marks my transition to a full on lover of stouts. This has to be one of the best beers in the world, it is fantastic.\",\n",

Very little head, maybe an 8th of an inch or so during a heavy handed pour. What little lacing produced was almost sheet like with cohesion. Nice! \\t\\tSmell: The nose of this beer is very complex. Beides the coffee and chocolate malts I noted the alcohol - a fruity estery smell, looming smoke, and hints of burnt bread.\\t\\tTaste: There is no doubt about it, coffee is the underlying flavor of this brew. A smokey coffee, almost Sumatra like (I decided to look it up, Sumatra and Kona). I impressed myself on that one. There was a distinct flavor that I had a hard time placing, I'm still swaying on this one, but I want to say graphite.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Much more carbonation than I was expecting. It is a medium bodied beer, which was very surprising - during the pour I just knew this was going to be one dense viscous treat. It also has a dry finish, enjoyable, keeping me going for another sip. \\t\\tDrinkability: I think the amount of carbonation and the acidity detract from the drinkability of this well crafted beer. I would love to try this beer off nitrogen.\\t\\tI like an early morning beer just as much as the next, but this may be a little too much for me at dawn.\",\n",

Just boozy enough, the coffee and chocolate from the regular BS are there backed by roasted malts with tones of bourbon coming through. The slightly sweet vanilla, caramel, toffee, oak are wonderful.\\t\\tA lot of the same flavors come through in the taste. Alcohol just slightly present- enough to let you know its there. But not intrusive. Such a full, coating mouthfeel of chocolate and roasted coffee beans. As drinkable as could be for a monster of this ABV and style. Overall, I liked this release a lot more fresh than the 2008- the slightly tweaked recipe was definitely an improvement. It will be interesting to see how this one develops with a little age on it.\",\n",

Really light punch of hops almost recalls a British Bitter. This is some really good stuff. Most other Helles are more of a focus on th quality and complexity of the malt, yielding a predominantly bready aroma, this one is really a feature of fresh grassy hops, providing a light lemony tang that is really enjoyable\\tFlavor reminds me of the Augustiner Helles, with an added Hallertau punch. Light bready malts, sweet citrus, a clean amount of carbonation, bitter mineral quality, finishing with a cleansing amount of Hallertau bite. Coming back to this beer several times really provides a fresh zippy bite of Hops, I've had several bottles prior to reviewing and everyone seems to be a little different\\tMouthfeel is clean, light and ends with a pleasently bitter bite. This style is so great as it can pair with light appetizers, seafood, as well as heavy entrees with its cleansing properties. Good example of a classic style\",\n",

Poured the darkest shade of brown, almost black, but not quite. Off-white head that dissipated quickly into a thin skim of foam; thin, consistent lacing through the tasting. Nose presented with strong aromas of molasses, malt and brown sugar. Flavor similar to the nose, as well as strong flavors of coffee and chocolate, that become more palatable through the tasting. Full mouthfeel with a milky smooth finish. Some alcohol astringency, but not at all unpleasant - also a somewhat earthy, smoky ending. Very pleasant and could become a staple.',\n",

Decent lacing for sure\\t\\tS- strong alcohol notes up front followed by a some what wheat like barley note thats gott a sweet yet bitter smelling side. Decent hop presence in their as well. Seems like theres some darker notes in there but i cant put my finger on them. Its weird when i first poured it the aroma blasted off the pour but now thats its sat theres not much happenin.\\t\\tT- Interesting. Up front on the tongue you get a serious hop profile that slams your palate but is immediately followed by a slightly roasted barley malts. After it goes down you get nice hints of dark fruits or raisins and a good amount of molasses and burnt sugars. Definitely some alcohol fullness as it warms but not bad.\\t\\tM- medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice strong bitter finish. \\t\\tOverall this is a great complex and very unique barleywine. Definitely a must try if your into this style. The crazy amount of hops belend so well with the barley and dark fruits and sugars. Definitelty a well thought out and blended beer.\\t\\tSkal!',\n",

And finally what seems to be a mildly tart-like apple or pear aroma. Not bad.\\t\\tT/M: A nice big burst of lemongrass and citrus up front, short sugar cookie middle, and a quick drying finish.

The finish is slightly bitter from the hops and roasted malts with a light alcohol burn (though surprisingly little for being 12%).\\t\\tM: Thick, oily slick body with low carbonation, this beer avoids being so sweet that it coats your mouth.

Not much more to say there.\\t\\tFor a pale ale, the flavor is coarse and raw, but any hop lover who usually shies away from mere pale ales for being too tame, this will surprise and delight.

A very faint whiff of hops in the background, enough to let you know that this won\\'t be overtly sweet.\\t\\tWhile the smell might not knock you out, the flavor is huge! This falls into style pretty squarely: huge malt bomb aged in bourbon barrels. The alcohol occasionally comes through as \"hot.\" It seems like they used fresh bourbon barrels, since that aspect of the beers flavor is so strong. There are basically three components to Backwood\\'s flavor: one is the bourbon wood, two is the caramel malt sweetness, and the third is a slight hop bitterness.\\t\\tAs on might expect, the beer is full-bodied. Yet there is substantial carbonation here, enough to prevent this one from every becoming syrupy or even chewy.\\t\\tThey weren\\'t kidding about this one being a \"kick-back sipper.\" Huge alcohol presence in this one.

Hop resins, alcohol esters, and peach dominate. Some citrus and mangos are in there as well. \\t\\tThe flavor begins with some tropical fruit sweetness with pineapple and kiwi. That soon is cut out by the grapefruit alcohol flavor. The alcohol flavor, however, is minimal. The grapefruit really shines. Some English toffee rides in underneath with notes of caramel and nuts. An intense burst of hop resins comes through towards the finish. It seems really concentrated. The hoppy finish is cut off however by a wave of acidity and the finish leaves me rather quickly. This makes for taking another sip quite quickly. \\t\\tNice medium body which supports the weight of the flavors yet goes down smoothly. ABV is 10%? No way. \\t\\tOverall, this is a maltier version of the DIPA style with some intense hop notes here and there. Never really too bitter nor overly sweet. This is good but I like some other examples of the style a bit better. Still, definitely worth a try.\",\n",

Strong dank hops with onions mixed in. Almost like someone threw together a bag full of lawn clippings, pot, onions and a few citrus rinds. Alcohol smell is prevalent as well. If we were rating on how strong it smells, I'd give it an A+...since I'm rating it on how an Imperial IPA smells, I'll give it a 3.5...and I'm being a little generous. Just too many things going on at once make it a little hard to enjoy.\\t\\tT.\\t\\tAt the first sip there is a touch of sweetness then a huge hop assault comes in. Same flavors as expected from the nose. Like some blended some pot, weeds, onions and maybe a little citrus fruit and pine resin. Finish is surprisingly smooth at the very end from the sweet malts. Alcohol is noticeable. If you can chew your way through taste it's not terrible, but the flavors are somewhat of a turnoff. A lot of the flavors seem to be fighting with each other and nothing stands out. It's almost like this is a novelty beer Founder's put out just to show you how hoppy and extreme they can make a beer. I get an aftertaste of plants, fruit rinds and plant resin.\\t\\tM.\\t\\tmedium to full bodied. good carbonation. Kind of an oily mouthfeel. Decent IMO.\\t\\tO.\\t\\tOther than maybe to try on tap, I doubt I'll try this fresh again. At least with the 2011 batch. I'm very interested to see how a year of age would do with this (yes, age a DIPA..make that a TIPA). As said previously...seems more like a novelty beer than anything else.

Builds a rather flat 2 fingered head that lasts as a little cap for almost the whole beer. Absolutely insane amounts of carbonation rising from the glass. A pretty moderate amount of lacing.\\t\\tS - Smell is actually a bit more mild than I would've expected. Heavy notes of citrus with the pine and hops taking a backseat. The fruits really dominate the nose and next comes a flowery lightness, then pine. Relatively smooth blended and refreshing.\\t\\tT - However, the taste is completely reversed. This beer really does have a bitter profile. Bitter in front, bitter in back. In between, though, is where this beer shines. Lemon, grapefruit, orange, and freshly cut grass welcome the mouth after the initial bitterness, but not content with the early exit, the bitterness comes back with a vengeance soon after. It's a shame, really, as the fruit and floral are the best part of this beer, but are too short-lived to make a big impact.\\t\\tM - Mouthfeel is pleasant. The head actually lends a creamy characteristic which is welcome and unusual in the style, but helps contrast with the bitterness. Heavily carbonated throughout.\\t\\tD - Drinkability is moderate. I am left wondering how great this beer would be if the bitterness were turned down a bit, because as of now, the bitterness really detracts from the beer's drinkability. Alcohol is hidden well, and the flavors are spot on.\",\n",

Slightly malty sweet up front, but the finish is dry from the hop bitterness, and slight lemon and grain flavors linger on into the aftertaste with almost a light mineral tang.\\t\\tMouthfeel-Medium body, with moderately high carbonation. \\t\\tCertainly a solid pale ale, but it doesn't really stand out from the pack. Strikes me as just kinda meh.\",\n",

It has a very bitter hop taste that goes down slow with a touch of warmth. There's adequate malt balance, but nothing that stands out. I find the hop character to be quite piney, to the point where it resinates in the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is your classic East Coast IPA. It's solid with the malt base, pale and crystal malts, along with a more spicy/piney hop arrangement. Not bad, but nothing I'd reach for again.\",\n",

Nothing too distinctive, but not too bad either (which pretty much sums up my general opinion of all Stoudts' beers).

You wouldn't want more than one at once, but it's not intended like that.\\t\\tAlso, I got it right from the source, at Founders, about two weeks after release... pretty cool.\",\n",

Huge citric hop whiff with lots of tangy lemon, orange, pineapple, sherbet and passionfruit. Hint of pear as well and mild pine resin as well lending an earthier bitterness to it. All grounded well, but a good dose of tangy hop oomph. Lovely, as I said.\\t\\tTaste is actually mildly disappointing, especially on the hop front. Good caramel malt with a touch of toffee upfront. Bit mild on the mid-palate before hop flavours start developing - floral largely with a hint of noticeable rind bitterness. Fruity, though, and flaxy and a metallic tinge to it. The bitterness though is largely an aftertaste without a huge finish and it creeps up more gradually than I'd expect (almost makes me think of this in English IPA terms but the hops are definitely more American in aroma and flavour).\\t\\tA bit thin on the mouthfeel which doesn't help, quite sticky but doesn't quite fill the mouth.\\t\\tA pleasant drop overall, I just find the peaks and troughs happen in the wrong place sometimes.

       "  'review/text': \"It has been quite some time since I have drank a good Dopplebock, and tasted this brew in a recent beer tasting, thought it was interesting and decided to review it properly\\tPours out a suprisingly amber ale like color, nice ever-so-lightly tan head, extremly foamy, leaving delicate lacing as it slowly settles.\\tUpfront an inviting aroma of sweet malts, bready biscuits, lightly spiced, followed by a bracing wave of citric hoppiness. Rich amber malts meets a squeeze of fresh grapefruit juice. A nice sweet malty backbone provides just enough ground to keep this brew in definate distinction from a hoppy amber ale. It's a bit bigger, juicier, and full bodied.\\tUpfront on the palate caramelized malty sugars, followed by an unique experience of hoppiness I've never experienced in a Dopplebock. Grapefruit, mango, a lighter peppery finish, drying, long and lingering. Could this be the world's first light bodied dopplebock? Whatever it is, it's quite drinkable, as the contents of my glass rapidly diminish.\\tThis reminds me of a way of Brooklyn's Hopfen-Weisse,in it's great European execution of standard of and skill, combined with a little New-Age twist. This is an extremely refreshing and great change to regular bock, which tends to be a bit sweet. \\tStoudts continues on it's streak in my book with solid brew after solid brew.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'The beer pours a solid copper color, a bit darker then I normally expect for an IPA. Head retention is decent and there is fair to good lacing. On the nose I get the protypical orange citrus aroma, with a touch of pine. Smells like a moderately hoppy IPA. On the palate this beer is quite delicious. It\\'s very well balanced with a nice blending of hops and malt, and the flavor profile includes ranier cherry, fuji apple and orange citrus. This is a very easy drinking IPA, one that is easy to enjoy. It\\'s not too heavy and finishes with a refreshing hoppy bite. The abv. is very well disguised and the beer is quite drinkable. \\t\\tThis is a very nice IPA. Everything seems to be in preportion and I could easily see drinking this on a hot day in the summer.

       "  'review/text': 'The last of a 6 pack broght back by a friend from Michigan. Sorry to see it go...\\t\\tThe beer pours a reddish amber color with fair head retention and lacing. The beer smells pretty sweet and malty, but with some nice underlying rye and hoppy citrus. Smells pretty good in fact. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, though the beer is decidedly on the hoppy side (which explains why I like the beer so much). The beer has a very nice bitter citrus bite to it, and comes across as crisp and clean. This beer is not the least bit heavy and is quite refreshing on the palate. It finishes very well, with a clean, light wash at the end. The beer is very drinkable with the abv. very well disguised (is it really 6.8% abv?).\\t\\tAnother solid beer from Founders. What a surprise. :-)',\n",
